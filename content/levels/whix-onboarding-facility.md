# WHIX Onboarding Facility: The Corporate Gateway

The first level of WHIX introduces players to a world where neurodivergent traits are simultaneously valued and exploited, where corporate efficiency masks psychological manipulation, and where the simple act of seeking employment becomes a complex navigation of surveillance, assessment, and potential resistance.

## Tutorial with Purpose

### Meaningful Introduction
Rather than generic tutorial mechanics, the onboarding facility teaches game systems through authentic corporate processes that reveal the world's underlying tensions and contradictions.

### Trait Discovery
Players learn about neurodivergent traits not through exposition but through practical application - noticing what others miss, processing information differently, responding to social situations uniquely.

### Choice Consequence Foundation
Early decisions establish patterns that affect relationships, corporate standing, and resistance connections throughout the game, demonstrating that every choice matters from the very beginning.

## Corporate Surveillance Introduction

### Omnipresent Monitoring
The facility introduces surveillance as environmental storytelling - cameras in every corner, biometric scanners at every checkpoint, AI voices analyzing speech patterns and emotional responses.

### Psychological Assessment Disguised as Routine
Standard corporate procedures like personality tests and skill assessments are revealed to be comprehensive psychological profiling designed to identify exploitable traits and resistance potential.

### Neural Baseline Establishment
The seemingly beneficial neural interface setup is actually the beginning of ongoing mental monitoring, establishing baseline patterns that will be used to detect future "anomalies."

## Neurodivergent Representation

### Positive Trait Portrayal
Each neurodivergent trait provides genuine advantages in navigating corporate complexity - pattern recognition reveals hidden algorithms, enhanced senses detect concealed surveillance, systematic thinking enables thorough analysis.

### Authentic Experiences
Corporate environments that feel overwhelming, sensory, or alienating to neurodivergent individuals are portrayed accurately while showing how different cognitive styles can adapt and even thrive.

### Community Connection
Meeting other neurodivergent candidates creates immediate solidarity and mutual recognition - the foundation of resistance networks begins with shared understanding of cognitive differences.

## Strategic Foundation

### Partner System Introduction
The partner assignment process teaches collaboration mechanics while establishing relationships that will define future gameplay - some partnerships enable resistance activities while others provide corporate advantages.

### Corporate Reputation Tracking
Early choices affect standing with corporate authorities, influencing access to missions, resources, and information while determining surveillance intensity.

### Resistance Network Seeding
Subtle resistance contacts and underground information begin establishing alternative support systems for players who demonstrate suspicious behavior or resistance sympathies.

## Adaptive Difficulty

### Authentic Challenge Scaling
Easy mode provides clearer indicators of corporate manipulation and resistance opportunities, while hard mode requires players to detect subtle psychological pressure and hidden agenda without assistance.

### Neurodivergent Accommodation
Difficulty affects timing pressure, sensory intensity, and information processing requirements rather than simply making obstacles harder or easier to overcome.

### Meaningful Support
Accessibility features are integrated as in-world technology and support systems rather than external game modifications, maintaining immersion while providing necessary accommodations.

This foundation level establishes WHIX's commitment to representing neurodivergent experiences authentically while creating engaging gameplay that demonstrates how cognitive differences can be both exploited and leveraged for resistance against oppressive corporate systems.
