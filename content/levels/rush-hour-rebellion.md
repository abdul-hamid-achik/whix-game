# Rush Hour Rebellion

## Mission Briefing

The factory workers in the Industrial District have had enough. After WHIX cut their wages by 40% while demanding doubled productivity, they've organized a strike. But WHIX controls the supply chains—no deliveries are getting through to the strikers.

That's where you come in.

## The Stakes

The strike camp needs food, water, and medical supplies to hold out. Every hour they survive is another crack in WHIX's armor. But the company has deployed enforcement squads to ensure no "unauthorized deliveries" reach the strikers.

This isn't just about tips anymore. This is about choosing a side.

## Environmental Hazards

### Corporate Checkpoints
WHIX has set up scanning checkpoints at major intersections. Your neurodivergent partners' enhanced senses can detect them from a distance, but you'll need to find alternative routes.

### Surveillance Grid
The Industrial District is blanketed with cameras and drones. Move during shift changes when the Algorithm's attention is divided.

### Crowd Dynamics
The streets are packed with protesters, supporters, and undercover corporate agents. Your social-focused partners can help identify who to trust.

## Special Mechanics

### Heat System
Each successful delivery increases corporate attention. At Heat Level 3, enforcement squads actively hunt you. Use cool-down spots in the Underground to reset your heat.

### Solidarity Network
Other couriers sympathetic to the cause will provide intel and distractions. Building these relationships is key to mission success.

### Time Pressure
The strikers' supplies dwindle in real-time. Efficient routing is critical, making hyperfocus and pattern recognition traits invaluable.

## Key Decisions

### The Corporate Offer
Midway through the mission, WHIX offers you triple pay to reveal the strike camp's location. Your choice affects:
- Humanity Index (major impact)
- Future mission availability
- Relationships with all rebel-aligned characters

### The Enforcer Encounter
When confronted by enforcement squads, you can:
1. **Fight** - Engage in combat (requires strong combat partners)
2. **Flee** - Use parkour and shortcuts (requires high stamina)
3. **Negotiate** - Use social skills to talk your way out (requires negotiator partner)
4. **Hack** - Disable their equipment (requires analyst partner with tech skills)

## Hidden Objectives

### The Documentary
A underground journalist is documenting the strike. Getting them footage of corporate brutality unlocks the "Truth Spreads" achievement and affects the game's ending.

### The Double Agent
One of the strikers is a corporate spy. Partners with enhanced perception or pattern recognition can identify them, preventing a tragic outcome.

## Post-Mission Consequences

Success leads to:
- The strike spreading to other districts
- Unlock of rebel safehouse
- Access to underground supply network
- Tania's personal questline

Failure results in:
- Strikers forced back to work
- Increased corporate surveillance
- Some partners lose faith in the rebellion
- Alternative, darker story path

## Developer Notes

This mission is designed to be a turning point where players must commit to the rebellion. The difficulty spike is intentional—success requires using partner abilities strategically and understanding the game's deeper mechanics.

The mission showcases how neurodivergent traits provide advantages:
- Hyperfocus for time management
- Enhanced senses for threat detection  
- Pattern recognition for finding safe routes
- Social processing differences for identifying allies

## Dialogue Samples

**Strike Leader**: "They say we're disrupting commerce. Good. Their commerce is built on our backs."

**WHIX Enforcer**: "You're interfering with Algorithm-optimized operations. Cease immediately or face termination... of employment."

**Sympathetic Courier**: "The scanner pattern changes every 15 minutes, but there's a gap at :23 and :38. My pattern recognition picked it up. Go, quickly!"
