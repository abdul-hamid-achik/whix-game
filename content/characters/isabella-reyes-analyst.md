backstory: |
  Once a star data analyst for WHIX's Behavioral Prediction Department, Isabella's ability to find patterns in chaos made her invaluable - until she found patterns they didn't want found.
  
  Her obsessive-compulsive traits, which WHIX initially exploited for quality control, led her to discover disturbing regularities in "random" delivery assignments. Neurodivergent partners were being systematically routed through specific neural scanning checkpoints. Data was being harvested.
  
  When she reported her findings, she was terminated for "productivity irregularities." Now she lives in the Cathedral undercroft, obsessively cataloging stolen packages, trying to decode the greater pattern she knows exists.
  
  "Everything connects," she mutters, arranging items by prime numbers. "The deliveries, the festivals, the neural scans - it's all one beautiful, terrible pattern."

  Isabella fights by analyzing and predicting enemy patterns. She excels at disrupting organized groups and corporate security, but struggles against chaotic or unpredictable opponents. Her OCD manifests in combat as precise, ritualistic movements that can be both a strength and vulnerability.

# Isabella "Izzy" Reyes - The Pattern Witch

In the damp undercroft of the Cathedral District, Isabella Reyes sees what others cannot - the hidden mathematics of oppression.

Her workspace is a shrine to organized chaos: stolen packages arranged in perfect spirals, delivery receipts pinned to walls in fractal patterns, holographic displays showing data flows that only she can interpret.

"WHIX thinks in straight lines," she explains, never taking her eyes off her screens. "But neurodivergent minds? We spiral, we loop, we see the connections they try to hide."

## Combat Capabilities

Isabella turns her obsessive pattern recognition into a weapon. She can predict enemy movements with uncanny accuracy, turning their own strategies against them. Her analytical mind processes battlefield data in real-time, finding weaknesses others miss.

However, her need for order can be exploited. Chaotic, unpredictable enemies can overwhelm her systems, and disrupting her carefully maintained patterns causes significant distress.

## Partnership Dynamics

With Miguel: Their shared hyperfocus creates a feedback loop of productivity and precision.

With Tania: Together, they become conspiracy theorists par excellence, unraveling corporate secrets with frightening efficiency.

"In the patterns," Isabella insists, "lies the truth of our enslavement - and perhaps, our liberation."
