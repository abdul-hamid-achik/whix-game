backstory: |
  Ricardo discovered his gift for understanding complex systems at age seven when he took apart and rebuilt his family's ancient washing machine - improving its efficiency by 23%. What others saw as obsessive behavior, he experienced as pure clarity: every component had a purpose, every connection followed logical patterns.
  
  His systematic thinking made traditional education frustrating. While teachers demanded rote memorization, Ricardo was redesigning the school's network architecture in his head. He dropped out at 16 to apprentice with underground tech collectives, learning that corporate systems were just another pattern to decode.
  
  Now he runs mobile repair operations, fixing what WHIX breaks. His ability to see patterns in seemingly random technical failures has revealed something disturbing: the malfunctions aren't random. They're designed to harvest data from neurodivergent minds.
  
  "Every 'glitch' follows a pattern," he insists, surrounded by perfectly organized components. "WHIX isn't just watching us - they're mapping how we think."

combat_style: |
  Ricardo approaches combat like debugging code - methodically identifying problems and implementing solutions. He excels against mechanical and corporate enemies but struggles with chaotic, unpredictable opponents.
dialogue_samples:
  - "The malware has seventeen distinct behavioral patterns. Sixteen are distractions. The seventeenth? That's where they hide the neural scrapers."
  - "Don't move that component! The organization system is based on failure probability matrices!"
  - "Your device isn't broken. It's doing exactly what WHIX wants it to do."
  - "I don't do small talk. Tell me the problem, I'll tell you the solution."
special_mechanics:
  - "Can hack certain environmental objects during combat"
  - "Provides technical solutions to puzzles that bypass combat"
  - "Repairs damaged equipment between missions for reduced cost"
technical_knowledge: |
  Ricardo's systematic thinking allows him to understand:
  - WHIX's neural harvesting infrastructure
  - Resistance communication networks
  - Corporate surveillance patterns
  - Device liberation techniques
  
  His workshop contains detailed diagrams of WHIX's entire technical ecosystem, painstakingly reverse-engineered from thousands of "routine" repairs.
recruitment_notes: |
  Ricardo joins if the player chooses either peaceful or digital resistance paths in Chapter 3. He refuses to work with those who abandon community for personal gain.
  
  "Your pattern is clear," he tells those who chose selfishly. "Incompatible with my optimization parameters."

# Ricardo "Tech" Morales - The System Liberator

In the chaos of Central Square, surrounded by broken devices and desperate voices, Ricardo Morales sees what others cannot: the elegant brutality of systematic oppression encoded in every circuit.

His repair stand is more than a business - it's a node in the resistance network. Every device he fixes is also liberated, corporate shackles replaced with open architectures. Every pattern he recognizes brings the underground closer to understanding WHIX's true agenda.

## The Beauty of Systems

Ricardo experiences the world through patterns and connections. Where others see random technical failures, he sees:

- Coordinated suppression algorithms targeting specific neural patterns
- Data harvesting disguised as routine diagnostics  
- Communication blocks that activate when resistance keywords are detected
- "Bugs" that are actually features designed to break solidarity

His systematic thinking isn't a limitation - it's his weapon against a system that counts on chaos to hide its crimes.

## Combat Through Understanding

In battle, Ricardo fights like he repairs: methodically, efficiently, and with perfect understanding of underlying systems. He doesn't just attack enemies - he debugs them, finding the flaws in their programming and exploiting them ruthlessly.

His partnerships with other neurodivergent minds create synergies that corporate algorithms can't predict. When patterns recognize patterns, when systems analyze systems, the facade of corporate control begins to crack.

## The Price of Clarity

Ricardo's clarity comes with costs. Small talk exhausts him. Social ambiguity frustrates him. But in a world where corporate doublespeak hides genocide, his inability to engage with dishonesty becomes revolutionary honesty.

"I don't understand why people accept broken systems," he says, organizing components by failure probability. "If something's broken, you fix it. If someone breaks it on purpose, you fix them."

In Ricardo, players find an ally who proves that systematic thinking isn't cold or emotionless - it's a passionate commitment to making things work properly, including human dignity.
