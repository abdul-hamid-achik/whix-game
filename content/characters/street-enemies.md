    level: 8
    description: "Gang member from Labyrinthine District driven to crime by corporate abandonment"
    backstory: |
      Once honest workers before WHIX algorithmatized their jobs away. The Desesperados formed when unemployment hit 80% in their neighborhood. They steal packages not from greed but from hunger - families to feed, medical bills from untreated conditions, rent for tenements that WHIX owns but doesn't maintain.
      
      "We're not criminals," says Carlos, their reluctant leader. "We're ecosystem responses to corporate parasitism."

  - id: "augmented-mugger"
    name: "Cyborg Predator"
    class: "tech_criminal"
    level: 12
    description: "Street criminal with black market augmentations"
    backstory: |
      Former WHIX warehouse worker who lost their job to automation. Used severance pay for illegal neural mods that now control them as much as enhance them. The augmentations demand constant maintenance fees, creating an addiction cycle that drives crime.
      
      Half their face glows with bargain-bin tech. Their augmented arm sparks when they're angry. They steal not just money but neural interface components, desperate to feed their mechanical parasites.

  - id: "corporate-enforcer"
    name: "WHIX Security Officer"
    class: "corporate_military"
    level: 15
    description: "Professional security working for corporate interests"
    backstory: |
      Clean uniforms, proper training, corporate health benefits. They enforce WHIX policy with the efficiency of those who believe the system works - mostly because it works for them.
      
      Many are former military, promised stability in exchange for not asking questions. They genuinely believe they're maintaining order, protecting property, and serving justice. The cognitive dissonance when they witness neural harvesting creates either complicity or defection.
    stats:
      health: 140

      defeat: "I was just... following orders..."
  
  - id: "tunnel-dweller"
    name: "Underground Survivor"
    class: "feral_human"
    level: 6
    description: "Person driven to live in tunnels by corporate displacement"
    backstory: |
      Not criminals by choice but by circumstance. When their neighborhood was gentrified for corporate housing, they fled underground. Years in the tunnels have changed them - pale from lack of sun, paranoid from constant hiding, territorial from scarcity.
      
      They attack delivery workers not from malice but from fear - corporate uniforms represent the system that erased their existence. Some retain enough humanity to be reasoned with. Others have retreated so far into survival mode that communication is impossible.
    stats:
      health: 65

    dialogue:
      opening: "Stay away! This is my tunnel!"
      reasoning_attempt: "You... you're not here to evict us?"
      flee: "The surface people... they always come back..."
    note: "Often can be helped rather than fought, providing valuable tunnel knowledge"
  
  - id: "data-pirate"
    name: "Information Thief"
    class: "cyber_criminal"
    level: 10
    description: "Hacker who steals and sells personal data"
    backstory: |
      Former corporate IT worker who discovered the extent of surveillance and data harvesting. Instead of fighting the system, they decided to profit from it. They steal neural patterns, delivery data, and personal information to sell on black markets.
      
      Morally ambiguous - they're parasites on an already exploitative system, but sometimes their data theft exposes corporate crimes. They justify their actions as "democratizing surveillance" while ignoring the harm to individuals.

      health: 90

# Street Enemies: The Human Cost of Corporate Dystopia

The streets of Neo-Singapore teem with those displaced, desperate, and driven to extremes by WHIX's systematic exploitation. Understanding these "enemies" reveals the true face of corporate oppression.

## The Economics of Desperation

### Los Desesperados (The Desperate Ones)
Not born criminals but made criminals by algorithmic unemployment. When 80% of jobs vanished overnight, families faced a choice: starve legally or survive illegally. The gang formed as mutual aid turned criminal by necessity.

Their territory in the Labyrinthine District marks not conquest but refuge - the only place WHIX surveillance fails, where displaced families can exist without optimization scores and productivity metrics.

### Augmented Addicts
Corporate severance packages designed to create dependency. "Get enhanced, stay competitive," WHIX promised. The reality: expensive modifications requiring constant maintenance, creating technological junkies who must steal to feed their mechanical parasites.

Their tragedy lies not in their crimes but in their exploitation - turned into cyborgs to serve corporate efficiency, then abandoned when cheaper automation emerged.

## The System's Enforcers

### Corporate Security
Clean uniforms hide dirty work. These professionals genuinely believe they serve order, stability, and justice. Their equipment is top-tier, their training comprehensive, their faith in the system absolute.

The cognitive dissonance between their values and their orders creates either committed enforcers or eventual defectors. Some become the resistance's most valuable allies when they finally see what they've been protecting.

## Underground Survivors

### Tunnel Dwellers
Gentrification's ghosts. When their neighborhoods became corporate housing, they didn't relocate - they went underground. Years in darkness have changed them, but their essential humanity remains.

They attack not from evil but from terror. Every corporate uniform represents the system that erased their existence from official records. Beneath the survival instincts, many retain enough hope to be reached.

## The Digital Underworld

### Data Pirates
Information is the new currency, and these hackers are its thieves. Former corporate IT workers who saw the surveillance apparatus from inside and chose profit over protest.

Morally complex figures who sometimes expose corporate crimes while perpetrating their own. They democratize access to information by stealing it from everyone equally.

## Combat Philosophy

Fighting these enemies requires understanding their motivations:
- **Desperate criminals** often respond to offers of legitimate aid
- **Corporate enforcers** can be turned by revealing systemic corruption  
- **Tunnel dwellers** need trust more than combat
- **Augmented addicts** require rehabilitation, not elimination
- **Data pirates** trade in information - offer better data than money

The real enemy isn't the person wielding the weapon - it's the system that forced the weapon into their hand.
