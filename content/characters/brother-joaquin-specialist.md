personality: "Former seminary student turned liberation theologist hacker"
backstory: |
  Joaquín was studying to become a priest when the Church merged with WHIX corporate interests. His autism and ADHD, which the seminary saw as obstacles to ordination, became his greatest assets in recognizing the perversion of faith.
  
  His time blindness, once a "deficit," allows him to work on breaking encryption for days without rest. His sensory differences make him acutely aware of the subliminal frequencies hidden in the Cathedral's "holy" broadcasts.
  
  "They preach prosperity gospel while bleeding the poor," he says, fingers flying across homebrew hacking equipment. "Christ threw out the money changers. It's time we did the same."
  
  Now he operates from hidden server rooms, using stolen Church bandwidth to coordinate resistance cells and jam corporate prayers. His modified rosary doubles as a signal scrambler.

# Brother Joaquín - The Digital Heretic

In the shadow of the Cathedral's spires, Brother Joaquín Martinez wages a different kind of holy war.

His makeshift chapel in the maintenance tunnels serves those the Church abandoned - neurodivergent workers deemed "unfit" for salvation under the new corporate doctrine. Here, he preaches a gospel of liberation while his modded equipment broadcasts counter-signals to jam WHIX's neural harvesting.

"They say we're broken," he tells his small congregation of delivery partners. "But maybe it's their world that needs fixing."

## Combat Philosophy

Joaquín brings righteous anger to every fight. His time blindness becomes an asset in battle - while enemies plan in linear time, he exists in an eternal present of hyperfocused fury. His attacks seem chaotic but follow a deeper rhythm only he perceives.

His seminary training emerges in unexpected ways: exorcism protocols repurposed to purge corporate malware, liturgical chants that disrupt AI frequencies, and theological arguments that cause logic loops in security systems.

## The True Faith

"The real heresy," Joaquín insists, adjusting his signal-jamming rosary, "is turning faith into a productivity metric. They measure prayer completion rates and optimize confession algorithms. But grace cannot be algorithmatized. Love cannot be leveraged. And neurodivergent souls are not bugs to be patched - we're features of humanity they're trying to deprecate."

In battle or in solidarity, Brother Joaquín represents faith weaponized against its own corruption - a digital prophet crying out in the corporate wilderness.
