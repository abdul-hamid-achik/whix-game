backstory: |
  Miguel Lopez grew up in the Labyrinthine District watching his neighborhood slowly consumed by corporate gentrification. His family ran a small grocery store until WHIX's algorithmic pricing drove them out of business, forcing Miguel into the gig economy he now depends on for survival.
  
  His neurodivergent traits - hyperfocus and pattern recognition - make him valuable to WHIX but also dangerous to their operations. The same analytical abilities that optimize delivery routes also detect the systematic exploitation hidden within corporate efficiency metrics.
  
  "I used to think my anxiety was a weakness," Miguel reflects, watching corporate drones patrol his old neighborhood. "But maybe it's just my brain recognizing that something's fundamentally wrong with a system that treats human beings like data points to be optimized."
  
  Miguel's journey from corporate compliance to resistance leadership represents the awakening of ordinary people to their own power when they choose community solidarity over individual survival.

  "The delivery algorithm optimizes for corporate profit, not human need. But what if we could reverse-engineer it? Use their own efficiency metrics to identify the families most at risk for harvesting, the neighborhoods targeted for gentrification, the workers pushed closest to breakdown?"
  
  His dialogue blends technical analysis with genuine empathy:
  
  "I can see the pattern in their targeting data. They're not randomly selecting people for optimization - they're systematically hunting neurodivergent individuals because our cognitive differences make us valuable to their algorithms. We're not broken. We're being harvested."
