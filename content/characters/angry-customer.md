backstory: |
  These customers have been conditioned by the gig economy to expect instant gratification at the lowest possible cost. They view delivery workers as expendable parts of a system designed to serve them, never considering the human cost of their demands.

  Their anger often stems from their own stress and dissatisfaction with life, which they redirect at the easiest target - the delivery worker who can't fight back without risking their job.

# The Angry Customer

## Psychology Profile

The Angry Customer represents the dark side of consumer culture in the gig economy. They've been trained by corporations to view workers as interfaces rather than people, leading to dehumanizing interactions that strip away dignity from both parties.

## Combat Behavior

In "combat" (arguments), Angry Customers rely on:
- **Verbal Aggression**: Loud complaints meant to overwhelm
- **Economic Threats**: Withholding tips or demanding refunds
- **System Exploitation**: Using the rating system as a weapon

## Common Variants

### The Cold Food Complainer
*"This food is ice cold! You took forever!"*
- Higher attack, lower defense
- Focuses on blaming the courier for restaurant delays

### The Wrong Order Accuser  
*"This isn't what I ordered! Can't you read?"*
- Balanced stats
- Often refuses to acknowledge their own ordering mistakes

### The No-Tip Threatener
*"Why should I tip for terrible service?"*
- Lower health, higher speed
- Quick to anger but easily defeated with proof

## Defeat Conditions

Angry Customers can be "defeated" through:
- **De-escalation**: Remaining calm reduces their power
- **Documentation**: Showing delivery proof deflates their arguments
- **Empathy**: Unexpected kindness sometimes breaks through their anger
- **Corporate Deflection**: Redirecting their anger to the system rather than you

## Rewards

Defeating an Angry Customer typically yields:
- **Tips**: 0-20 (they rarely tip well even when appeased)
- **Experience**: 20 XP (valuable lessons in conflict resolution)
- **Humanity**: -5 (these encounters drain your soul)

## Cultural Context

In Polanco's dystopian gig economy, Angry Customers are both victims and perpetrators. They're squeezed by the same economic forces that oppress couriers, but instead of solidarity, they punch down at those with even less power.

Their existence highlights how corporate systems pit workers and consumers against each other, preventing them from recognizing their common enemy: the platforms that exploit them both.
