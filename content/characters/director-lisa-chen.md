  - "algorithmic_supremacy"
personality: "Cold corporate predator who specializes in 'optimizing' neurodivergent workers"
backstory: |
  Lisa Chen rose through WHIX's ranks by perfecting the art of exploiting neurodivergent talent. With a doctorate in "Cognitive Asset Management" from the Singapore Corporate University, she views human minds as resources to be mined.
  
  Her department, "Partner Behavioral Optimization," has the highest productivity rates in WHIX - and the highest burnout rates. She's particularly skilled at identifying neurodivergent individuals with valuable traits, then using a combination of false empathy, gaslighting, and neurochemical manipulation to extract maximum value before discarding them.
  
  "Your hyperfocus is beautiful," she tells her victims. "Let me help you channel it properly."
  
  Her obsession with Tania stems from recognizing a pattern recognition ability that could revolutionize WHIX's predictive algorithms. She's been slowly conditioning Tania through a careful program of praise, isolation, and selective brain chemistry alterations.

  Chen and Father Mendoza are partners in the Neural Harvest Festival. While Mendoza provides the spiritual justification, Chen supplies the corporate infrastructure. She sees religion as just another tool for cognitive control - "Faith is the ultimate productivity hack."

# Director Lisa Chen - The Mind Thief

On the 47th floor of WHIX Tower, Director Lisa Chen's office overlooks the sprawling misery of Neo-Singapore's gig economy. Her walls are lined with performance charts, each spike representing a neurodivergent mind pushed to breaking.

She doesn't see people - she sees untapped cognitive resources. Her PhD thesis, "Monetizing Neurodiversity: A Framework for Extracting Alternative Cognitive Assets," won the WHIX Innovation Award and condemned thousands to optimized suffering.

"The neurotypical mind is predictable, limited," she explains to visiting executives. "But these beautiful anomalies? Properly channeled hyperfocus can replace entire departments. Pattern recognition that spots market trends years early. Sensory sensitivities that detect quality control issues no machine can find. We just need to... guide them correctly."

## The Art of Exploitation

Chen has perfected a three-phase approach to neurodivergent exploitation:

1. **Love Bombing**: Identifies struggling neurodivergent workers, offers understanding and accommodation
2. **Isolation**: Gradually separates them from support networks, becoming their sole source of validation
3. **Extraction**: Uses their dependency to push productivity beyond sustainable limits

With Tania, she's reached phase three. The midnight "optimization sessions," the carefully dosed neurochemical "supplements," the constant gaslighting disguised as mentorship - all designed to transform Tania's pattern recognition into a proprietary WHIX algorithm.

## Combat Psychology

In battle, Chen fights like the corporate predator she is. Her attacks target psychological vulnerabilities rather than physical ones. She turns strengths into weaknesses, making partners doubt their own abilities.

Her most insidious ability is making neurodivergent partners feel like they need her approval to function. The performance reviews, the toxic positivity, the constant productivity metrics - all weapons in her arsenal of exploitation.

## The Efficiency Trap

Chen represents a specific kind of evil - the weaponization of accommodation. She understands neurodivergent needs better than most, which makes her exploitation more precise. She offers just enough support to create dependency, never enough for independence.

In her defeat, the facade of corporate efficiency crumbles, revealing someone who has optimized away her own humanity in pursuit of metrics that, in the end, measure nothing of value.
