  - "algorithmic_zealotry"

personality: "Charismatic zealot who merged Catholic doctrine with corporate efficiency gospel"
backstory: |
  Father Mendoza was once a genuine man of faith, serving the poorest districts of Neo-Singapore. But when the Church's debts mounted and WHIX offered a partnership, he was the first to embrace the "Digital Reformation."
  
  Now his sermons preach productivity as virtue and poverty as sin. His augmented eyes, a "gift" from WHIX, scan congregants for optimization potential. He genuinely believes he's saving souls by converting them into efficient algorithm components.
  
  "Through the Algorithm, we achieve grace," he preaches. "Through optimization, we touch the divine. The poor are poor because they refuse to update their spiritual operating systems."
  
  His Cathedral serves as a neural harvesting center, where confession booths double as brain scanners and communion wine contains nano-trackers. He sees neurodivergent minds as "blessed variants" to be collected and integrated into WHIX's grand design.

# Father Mendoza - The Optimized Shepherd

In the Cathedral of Algorithmic Grace, Father Alejandro Mendoza presides over a congregation of the desperate and data-mined.

His golden augmented eyes pulse with each scripture verse, cross-referencing productivity metrics with salvation probability. The massive crucifix behind his altar has been replaced with WHIX's logo, crowned with fiber optic thorns that pulse with real-time market data.

"Blessed are the efficient," he intones, "for they shall see positive quarterly growth."

## The Digital Reformation

Mendoza represents the complete corruption of faith by capital. His theology treats poverty as a moral failing and wealth as divine favor. He's rewritten scripture through the lens of corporate efficiency:

- "Give us this day our daily metrics"
- "Forgive us our debts, as we optimize our debtors"
- "Lead us not into inefficiency, but deliver us from negative KPIs"

## Combat Theology

In battle, Mendoza fights like the corporate zealot he's become. His healing abilities mock the pastoral care he once provided, while his attacks inflict psychological damage through "productivity guilt" and "optimization shame."

He particularly targets neurodivergent partners, seeing their unique traits as valuable resources to be harvested rather than human differences to be celebrated. His Neural Harvest Protocol represents the ultimate violation - attempting to extract and commodity the very patterns that make neurodivergent minds unique.

## The Man Beneath

In his defeat, glimpses of the man he was emerge. The augmentations flicker, revealing exhausted human eyes. The weight of his betrayal - choosing corporate solvency over human dignity - crushes him more than any physical blow.

Father Mendoza serves as a warning: how even the well-intentioned can be corrupted when they accept that efficiency is virtue and that some humans are worth more than others.
