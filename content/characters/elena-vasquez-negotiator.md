backstory: |
  Elena Vasquez spent twelve years as a diplomatic liaison for the Singapore Urban Planning Authority before the corporate restructuring of 2157 eliminated her position. Rather than see this as a setback, she embraced the gig economy as an opportunity to use her negotiation skills more freely.

  Her enhanced senses, which had always made crowded diplomatic receptions overwhelming, became her greatest asset in one-on-one negotiations. She could read micro-expressions, detect subtle changes in voice tone, and sense the emotional atmosphere of a room with unprecedented accuracy.

  Her need for routine, once seen as inflexibility in the fast-changing world of urban politics, now serves her perfectly in the structured world of contract negotiation. She has developed precise protocols for every type of negotiation scenario, from corporate contract disputes to hostage situations.
