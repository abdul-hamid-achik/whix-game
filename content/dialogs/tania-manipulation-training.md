[A sterile corporate training room with two-way mirrors and recording equipment. Tania sits across from Director Chen while a "customer service trainer" observes]

**Director Chen**: "Tania, your pattern recognition skills are remarkable. Today we're going to teach you how to use them to help customers make better decisions."

**Tania**: [Uncertain] "Better decisions? I thought I was just supposed to deliver packages efficiently."

**Corporate Trainer**: "Think bigger, Tania. You interact with dozens of families every day. Imagine if you could help them solve their problems - financial stress, housing issues, family conflicts."

**Director Chen**: "Your ability to read micro-expressions and detect stress patterns makes you uniquely qualified for our Advanced Community Liaison program."

**Tania**: "Community liaison? That sounds... helpful."

**Corporate Trainer**: [Showing surveillance footage] "Watch this interaction from last week. See how this customer's voice stress indicates financial anxiety? Notice the family tension in the background?"

**Tania**: [Studying the footage] "Yes, I can see the patterns. The father's avoiding eye contact, the mother's defensive posture, the child's withdrawal behavior..."

**Director Chen**: "Excellent analysis. Now, what if you could guide that family toward solutions that would relieve their stress?"

**Corporate Trainer**: "We've partnered with financial services, housing consultants, and family counseling programs. You'd be connecting people with resources they need."

**Tania**: [Brightening] "That actually sounds really meaningful. I've always wanted to help people, not just deliver things to them."

**Director Chen**: [Smile becoming predatory] "Perfect. Let's start with basic psychological assessment techniques."

[The trainer pulls out a manual titled "Customer Vulnerability Assessment and Optimal Intervention Strategies"]

**Corporate Trainer**: "First, you'll learn to identify what we call 'stress indicators' - financial pressure, relationship conflicts, social isolation, employment instability."

**Tania**: [Reading] "This seems very... detailed. You want me to assess people's entire life situations?"

**Director Chen**: "Only to help them, Tania. How can you provide appropriate solutions without understanding the full scope of their challenges?"

**Corporate Trainer**: "Here's a practical exercise. Based on your delivery interactions, identify five families who might benefit from 'optimization counseling.'"

**Tania**: [Hesitant] "The Ramirez family has been struggling. Financial stress, relationship conflicts. Little Alejandro seems to be suffering from the tension..."

**Director Chen**: [Making notes] "Excellent. What specific vulnerabilities did you observe?"

**Tania**: "Eduardo's working multiple gigs but still behind on rent. Carmen's frustrated and taking it out on the family. They're isolated from extended family support networks."

**Corporate Trainer**: "Perfect assessment. Now, imagine you could offer Eduardo a 'better opportunity' - higher-paying work in a different district. And Carmen could get family counseling and financial planning services."

**Tania**: [Suspicious] "Different district? Wouldn't that mean moving?"

**Director Chen**: "Sometimes relocation is the best solution for family stability. New environment, fresh start, escape from stressful associations."

**Corporate Trainer**: [Showing neighborhood maps] "We've identified several districts with better opportunities for families like the Ramirezes. Lower cost of living, better schools, more community support."

**Tania**: [Pattern recognition activating] "Wait... all these 'opportunity districts' are outside the city center. And all the families you're targeting are in neighborhoods marked for... what does this say? 'Development Priority'?"

**Director Chen**: [Tension rising] "Tania, you're overthinking this. We're simply matching families with opportunities that suit their needs."

**Tania**: [Standing up, alarmed] "You're not helping families. You're relocating them. This is... this is systematic displacement disguised as customer service."

**Corporate Trainer**: [Nervous] "Now, Tania, let's not jump to conclusions..."

**Tania**: [Backing toward the door] "My pattern recognition isn't broken, Director Chen. I can see exactly what this is. You want me to profile vulnerable families so you can manipulate them into leaving their communities."

**Director Chen**: [Dropping the facade] "Sit down, Tania. We need to discuss your contract obligations and the consequences of training program non-completion."

**Tania**: [Hand on door handle] "You can't force me to participate in community destruction."

**Director Chen**: "Can't I? Your housing is corporate-subsidized. Your work assignments come through our system. Your healthcare, your income, your social connections - all dependent on WHIX cooperation."

**Corporate Trainer**: [Reading from tablet] "Training program refusal constitutes breach of partnership agreement. Penalties include immediate termination, housing eviction, and permanent blacklisting from gig economy platforms."

**Tania**: [Realizing the trap] "You're... you're threatening to destroy my life if I don't help you destroy other people's communities."

**Director Chen**: "I'm offering you a choice, Tania. Use your remarkable abilities to help WHIX optimize community development, or find yourself optimized out of the system entirely."

**Tania**: [Long pause, calculating] "How long do I have to decide?"

**Director Chen**: [Smiling again] "Take the weekend. But remember - Monday morning, you're either our most valuable community liaison, or you're nobody at all."

[Tania leaves the room, understanding that she's not just trapped - she's being weaponized against her own community]
