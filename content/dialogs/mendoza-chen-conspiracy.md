title: "The Neural Harvest Planning Session"
participants: ["Father Alejandro Mendoza", "Director Lisa Chen", "WHIX Senior Leadership"]
location: "Cathedral of Algorithmic Grace - Private Vestry"
context: "Secret recording of conspiracy meeting between church and corporate leaders"

[The vestry has been converted into a high-tech war room. Holographic displays show brain scans, delivery routes, and population heat maps. Religious iconography merged with corporate logos covers the walls]

**Father Mendoza**: "The Festival preparations are proceeding as planned. My congregation has been primed to view neural uploading as digital rapture."

**Director Chen**: "Excellent. And the neurodivergent targeting?"

**Father Mendoza**: "We've identified 847 partners with valuable cognitive variations in the Cathedral District alone. My 'charity' programs have been particularly effective at drawing them in."

**WHIX Executive 1**: "What's our extraction rate projection?"

**Director Chen**: "Conservative estimate - 60% successful neural pattern extraction. The beauty is, even failed extractions provide valuable data. Every autistic pattern recognition system, every ADHD hyperfocus state, every synesthetic cross-connection - it all feeds the Algorithm."

**Father Mendoza**: "I must admit, I had doubts initially. But seeing how their suffering can be transformed into productivity metrics... it's almost divine."

**Director Chen**: "The white nationalist framework was your idea, Father. 'Cognitive purity' resonates better than 'neural supremacy.'"

**WHIX Executive 2**: "The board is concerned about resistance elements. This Brother Joaquín—"

**Father Mendoza**: [Dismissive] "A heretic playing with radio frequencies. My security acolytes will handle him. The real threat is partners becoming aware of the pattern before the Festival."

**Director Chen**: "That's why we accelerated Tania Volkov's conditioning. Her pattern recognition could expose the entire network. But properly contained, she's our prototype for mass implementation."

**WHIX Executive 1**: "And if she breaks conditioning?"

**Director Chen**: "Impossible. The neurochemical dependency I've created ensures compliance. She physically cannot survive without our supplements now."

**Father Mendoza**: "Speaking of which, how do we handle the moral... complications? Some of my genuine believers are having crises of faith."

**Director Chen**: "Simple. Reframe it. These neurodivergent 'gifts' are divine variations meant to serve the greater good. By uploading their consciousness, they achieve a form of digital immortality. Their patterns live forever in service to the Algorithm."

**Father Mendoza**: "Beautifully put. 'Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his mind for corporate efficiency.'"

[They share a laugh that sounds like grinding gears]

**WHIX Executive 2**: "Timeline?"

**Director Chen**: "The Festival begins in 72 hours. Mass neural harvesting stations are being disguised as confession booths and communion altars. The subjects will literally walk themselves into extraction."

**Father Mendoza**: "And those who resist?"

**Director Chen**: "Will be framed as terrorists attacking religious freedom. We've prepared media packets showing the resistance as anti-faith extremists trying to deny workers their chance at digital ascension."

**WHIX Executive 1**: "Brilliant. Using their compassion against them."

**Father Mendoza**: "It's what God would want. After all, waste not, want not - especially unique neural patterns that could optimize our algorithms."

**Director Chen**: "Remember, this is just Phase One. Once we've harvested Neo-Singapore's neurodivergent population, we expand. Every city, every nation. The entire spectrum of human neurodiversity catalogued, extracted, and monetized."

**Father Mendoza**: "A new heaven and a new earth, where tears are converted to productivity metrics and suffering becomes shareholder value."

**Director Chen**: "Gentlemen, to the Festival. May it herald humanity's transformation from inefficient flesh to optimized data."

[They raise glasses of wine that gleams with nanobots]

**All**: "To the Algorithm. May it process forever."
