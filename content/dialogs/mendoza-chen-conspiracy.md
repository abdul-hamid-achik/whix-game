**Father Mendoza**: "The community outreach programs are proceeding as planned. My congregation willingly shares family information during our 'pastoral care' sessions."

**Director Chen**: "Excellent. And the behavioral profiling data?"

**Father Mendoza**: "We've collected comprehensive psychological profiles on 847 families in the Cathedral District alone. Financial situations, family conflicts, social connections, personal vulnerabilities - all documented through confessional and counseling sessions."

**WHIX Executive 1**: "What's our displacement rate projection?"

**Director Chen**: "Conservative estimate - 60% successful relocations within 18 months. The beauty is, they don't realize they're being manipulated. Every family crisis we trigger, every financial pressure we apply, every social conflict we amplify - it all appears natural to them."

**Father Mendoza**: "I must admit, I had doubts initially. But seeing how their struggles can be monetized through strategic displacement... it's efficient resource optimization."

**Director Chen**: "The religious legitimacy framework was your idea, Father. 'God's plan for neighborhood improvement' resonates better than 'profit-driven displacement.'"

**WHIX Executive 2**: "The board is concerned about resistance elements. This Brother Joaquín—"

**Father Mendoza**: [Dismissive] "A heretic playing with radio frequencies. My security acolytes will handle him. The real threat is partners becoming aware of the pattern before the Festival."

**Director Chen**: "That's why we accelerated Tania Volkov's psychological training. Her pattern recognition could expose the entire surveillance network. But properly trained, she becomes our prototype manipulation specialist."

**WHIX Executive 1**: "And if she refuses the training?"

**Director Chen**: "Economic coercion. We control her work assignments, her income, her housing. Corporate dependency ensures compliance without obvious force."

**Father Mendoza**: "Speaking of which, how do we handle the moral... complications? Some of my genuine believers are having crises of faith."

**Director Chen**: "Simple. Reframe it. These surveillance programs are 'community care initiatives' - helping families manage financial stress and life challenges. Frame displacement as 'opportunity relocation' to better neighborhoods."

**Father Mendoza**: "Beautifully put. 'The Lord helps those who accept His guidance to greener pastures.'"

[They share a laugh that sounds like grinding gears]

**WHIX Executive 2**: "Timeline?"

**Director Chen**: "The displacement operation begins in 72 hours. Mass surveillance data will trigger coordinated financial pressure campaigns. Families will receive simultaneous rent increases, job terminations, and 'development opportunity' offers."

**Father Mendoza**: "And those who resist?"

**Director Chen**: "Will be framed as anti-progress extremists blocking community improvement. We've prepared media packets showing resistance as selfish individuals preventing neighborhood development that would benefit everyone."

**WHIX Executive 1**: "Brilliant. Using their compassion against them."

**Father Mendoza**: "It's what God would want. After all, waste not, want not - especially valuable real estate that could generate optimal returns."

**Director Chen**: "Remember, this is just Phase One. Once we've perfected surveillance-enabled displacement in Neo-Singapore, we expand. Every city, every nation. The entire urban landscape optimized for maximum profit extraction."

**Father Mendoza**: "A new heaven and a new earth, where communities are converted to development opportunities and neighborhood character becomes shareholder value."

**Director Chen**: "Gentlemen, to the displacement operation. May it herald humanity's transformation from inefficient communities to optimized real estate markets."

[They raise glasses of wine that gleams with surveillance microchips]

**All**: "To the Algorithm. May it optimize forever."
