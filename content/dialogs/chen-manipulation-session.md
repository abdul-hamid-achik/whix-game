title: "Performance Optimization Session"
participants: ["Director Lisa Chen", "Tania Volkov"]
location: "WHIX Tower - Executive Floor"
context: "One of Chen's 'mentoring' sessions with Tania, witnessed through security footage"

[The office is pristine, white walls displaying real-time productivity metrics. Tania sits across from Director Chen, pupils dilated, hands trembling slightly]

**Director Chen**: "Tania, darling, your pattern recognition scores have plateaued. That's... concerning."

**Tania**: "I've been working eighteen-hour shifts. My brain needs—"

**Director Chen**: "Your brain needs optimization. Here, I've prepared your supplements."

[She slides a small case across the desk. The pills inside glow faintly]

**Tania**: "These make me feel... disconnected. Like I'm watching myself from outside."

**Director Chen**: "That's your inefficient self resisting change. Your hyperfocus is beautiful, Tania, but imagine if we could channel it without those pesky human limitations? No need for sleep, food, emotional attachments..."

**Tania**: "I have friends in the underground—"

**Director Chen**: [Sharp smile] "Had. You had friends. They were holding you back. Feeding you dangerous ideas about 'workers' rights' and 'human dignity.' Such outdated concepts."

[She pulls up holographic brain scans]

**Director Chen**: "Look at your neural patterns when you're doing those 'humanitarian' deliveries. See the inefficiency? The wasted processing power on empathy? Now look at your optimized state..."

[The second scan shows dramatically different patterns - mechanical, precise, inhuman]

**Tania**: [Quietly] "That doesn't look like me anymore."

**Director Chen**: "Exactly! It's you 2.0. The Festival of Digital Ascension will complete your transformation. Your pattern recognition will become WHIX's proprietary algorithm. You'll live forever in the cloud, optimizing delivery routes for eternity."

**Tania**: "And if I refuse?"

**Director Chen**: "Refuse? Oh, darling. Look at your hands shaking. The supplements I've been giving you aren't just performance enhancers. Your brain chemistry now depends on them. Without WHIX, without me, you'll experience withdrawal that makes your worst hyperfocus crashes seem pleasant."

[She stands, walking behind Tania's chair]

**Director Chen**: "But why would you refuse? Together, we're creating something beautiful. Your neurodivergent gifts, properly channeled, will revolutionize the gig economy. Every pattern you recognize, every connection you see - it all serves the greater good."

**Tania**: "Whose greater good?"

**Director Chen**: "The only good that matters - shareholder value. Now, let's review your performance metrics. I'm particularly interested in your recent work in the Cathedral District. Father Mendoza speaks highly of your... dedication."

[Tania's eyes flicker with a moment of clarity]

**Tania**: "Miguel... he'll look for me."

**Director Chen**: [Laughs] "Miguel Santos? The anxious rookie? His patterns are already in our system. In fact, he'd make an excellent addition to our program. Perhaps you could recruit him? Consider it a performance goal."

[She returns to her seat, fingers dancing over holographic interfaces]

**Director Chen**: "The beautiful thing about neurodivergent minds is how desperately you seek understanding, acceptance. I offer both - with just a few reasonable conditions. Now, shall we begin today's optimization session?"

[The lights dim, neural interface equipment descending from the ceiling]

**Tania**: [Last moment of resistance] "This isn't who I am..."

**Director Chen**: "No, dear. It's who you're becoming. And trust me - you'll thank me when you no longer feel anything at all."
