      [Carmen shows Miguel a bottle of legitimate medication instead of neural stimulants]
      
      Carmen: "It's harder to work the quotas without the stims, but... at least Eduardo is still Eduardo."

      Father Santiago: "Six families so far have pulled their children from WHIX recruitment programs. But the Festival of Digital Ascension is in 72 hours."
      
      Ricardo: "I've been monitoring neural harvesting equipment shipments. They're not just targeting the Cathedral District anymore. Mobile units are being deployed across all districts."
      
      Isabella: [Surrounded by pattern charts] "The expansion follows predictable models. Crisis creation, family destabilization, recruitment opportunities. But there's something else..."
      
      [She points to aerial photos of different districts]
      
      Isabella: "Look at the targeting patterns. They're not random. They're following gentrification maps from ten years ago."
      
      Ekaterina: [Via secure communication] "I have intel from inside WHIX Tower. Tania's conditioning is nearly complete, but there's a complication. They're planning to use her as the poster child for voluntary optimization."
      
      Miguel: "What does that mean?"
      
      Ekaterina: "Live broadcast during the Festival. Tania 'choosing' optimization in front of thousands of viewers. They want to make neural harvesting look like enlightenment."

      [Tania's image dominates the screens - but something's wrong with her eyes]
      
      Ricardo: "The facial micro-expressions... she's fighting the conditioning. But barely."
      
      Miguel: "How long do we have?"
      
      Ricardo: "The neural pattern analysis suggests... maybe 48 hours before her resistance completely breaks. After that, she'll genuinely want to be harvested."
      
      [Miguel's neural interface buzzes with a fragmented message]
      
      Tania: [Barely audible] "Miguel... the patterns... I can see them all now... the families, the children, the expansion... they're not just targeting individuals... they're mapping entire genetic lines..."
      
      [Signal cuts to static]

      Miguel must decide how to allocate limited resistance resources across multiple district crises
      
      **Option 1**: Focus all resources on Tania's rescue
      - Pros: Save the most valuable resistance asset
      - Cons: Abandon families in immediate danger across districts
      
      **Option 2**: Spread resources thin to help as many as possible
      - Pros: Minimize overall suffering
      - Cons: Risk failing to save anyone effectively
      
      **Option 3**: Strategic triage - save those most likely to become resistance members
      - Pros: Build long-term resistance capability
      - Cons: Accept calculating approach to human worth
      
      Father Santiago: "This is what they want - to force us to choose between our values and our effectiveness."
      
      Miguel: "But if we don't choose, everyone suffers."

      Isabella: [From Cathedral District] "I'm tracking their deployment patterns, but I need Father Santiago's knowledge of underground routes to stay ahead of them."
      
      Father Santiago: [Coordinating evacuations] "The routes are open, but we need Miguel's community connections to trust us with their children."

      Stage Manager: "After 72 hours of conditioning? She'll be grateful for the opportunity. The audience will see genuine happiness as her consciousness uploads."
      
      [Miguel overhears WHIX executives discussing logistics]
      
      Executive 1: "How many will we process during the Festival?"

      Isabella: "The patterns suggest Tania will be the final presentation on the pyramid steps. If we can disrupt it before then..."
      
      Father Santiago: "But we're talking about infiltrating the Templo de la Eficiencia - a heavily guarded Party-State monument with thousands of Vigilantes Comunitarios and federal security."
      
      Ekaterina: [Via secure link] "I can get one person inside. Maybe two. But it's essentially a suicide mission."
      
      Miguel: [Voice steady] "Then I'll go. Tania's conditioning was my fault - I should have seen the signs earlier."
      
      Ricardo: "That's not how blame works, Miguel. WHIX created this situation."

      [He looks around at his assembled team]
      
      Miguel: "Three months ago, I was just an anxious courier trying to pay rent. Now I'm planning to attack a corporate fortress to save someone who might not even want to be saved anymore."

      heroic_rescue_attempt: |
        The resistance commits to the impossible rescue mission. Miguel will infiltrate the Festival of Digital Ascension while his team creates diversions across all districts.
        
        "We're probably all going to die," Ricardo observes matter-of-factly.
        
        "Maybe," Miguel replies. "But if we don't try, we're definitely going to lose our souls."
        
        As they prepare for what might be their final mission, each team member understands they're fighting not just for Tania, but for the idea that human consciousness cannot be owned, optimized, or extracted for corporate profit.
        
        The Festival approaches. The neural harvesting equipment powers up. And somewhere in WHIX Tower, Tania fights to remember who she was before they began rewriting her mind.
        
      strategic_documentation: |
        The team decides that saving one person isn't worth destroying their ability to save thousands. They'll document the Festival's crimes for future prosecution.
        
        "Tania would understand," Miguel tells himself, hating the words. "She'd want us to think strategically."
        
        The choice preserves the resistance but costs Miguel a piece of his humanity. How do you weigh one friend's life against a movement's survival?
        
        As they prepare surveillance equipment instead of rescue plans, Miguel wonders if strategic thinking is just another form of corporate optimization - reducing human worth to utilitarian calculations.
        
      diplomatic_approach: |
        Miguel decides to try the impossible - negotiating with WHIX executives for Tania's release. The team will gather leverage while he attempts to find common ground with corporate leadership.
        
        "You're insane," Ricardo tells him. "They don't negotiate. They optimize."
        
        "Then we'll speak their language," Miguel replies. "Show them that Tania's worth more as a voluntary ally than a harvested resource."
        
        The diplomatic approach requires Miguel to enter WHIX Tower willingly, knowing he might never leave. But sometimes the most revolutionary act is refusing to accept that violence is the only solution.

# Chapter 6: Gathering Storm

As the Festival of Digital Ascension approaches, Miguel discovers that individual resistance is no longer enough. The crises cascading across Mexico City's districts reveal WHIX's true strategy: overwhelming coordination that forces impossible choices between competing humanitarian needs.

The Ramirez family's recovery offers hope, but their situation multiplies across thousands of families facing similar corporate predation. Miguel's small team of allies must somehow coordinate responses to simultaneous emergencies while planning the impossible rescue of someone who may no longer want to be saved.

In the growing complexity of resistance work, Miguel confronts the hardest truth of systematic oppression: the system scales faster than individual responses, creating moral choices designed to break the spirits of those who refuse to submit.

Time is running out. Tania's conditioning deepens with each passing hour. The Festival's neural harvesting equipment powers up for mass optimization. And somewhere in the margins of corporate power, an unexpected ally prepares to emerge.

The gathering storm will test whether human solidarity can overcome algorithmic efficiency, whether love can resist optimization, and whether a small group of neurodivergent rebels can save both their friend and their humanity from a corporation that sees no difference between the two.

**Content Warning**: This chapter explores themes of organizational resistance, moral triage, and the psychological cost of fighting systematic oppression while maintaining human values.
