# Chapter 1: First Day on the Job

## Opening Scene

Rain hammers against the glass walls of the WHIX Distribution Center, each drop a pixel in the endless gray bitmap of Neo Prosperity's sky. You stand in line with dozens of other hopefuls, each clutching their acceptance notification like a lottery ticket.

The irony isn't lost on you. In a city where 67% of jobs have been algorithmatized away, being selected as a WHIX partner is considered lucky.

The person ahead of you—purple hair, nervous tics, constantly reorganizing their backpack—catches your eye. There's something familiar in the way they process the overwhelming sensory input of the facility.

## The Onboarding AI

"WELCOME, VALUED PARTNER CANDIDATE."

The voice comes from everywhere and nowhere, a synthesis of a thousand customer service representatives distilled into pure corporate efficiency.

"I AM WHIX-AI, YOUR ONBOARDING FACILITATOR. PLEASE NOTE: THIS INTERACTION IS BEING RECORDED FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE AND BEHAVIORAL PATTERN ANALYSIS."

The purple-haired person ahead of you mutters, "Quality assurance, right. More like looking for excuses to cut our pay."

### Choice Point 1: First Impression

How do you respond to the WHIX-AI's greeting?

1. **Stay Silent** - Better not to draw attention on day one
2. **Agree with Purple Hair** - "Heard they docked someone for blinking too much"
3. **Defend WHIX** - "At least it's work, right?"

## The Contract

A holographic contract materializes before you, its text scrolling faster than any human could read. The AI's voice continues its relentless onboarding:

"STANDARD PARTNER AGREEMENT. WHIX RETAINS 75% OF ALL TIPS AS PROCESSING AND PLATFORM FEES. PARTNERS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL EXPENSES. ACCEPTANCE INDICATES UNDERSTANDING OF TERMS."

Purple Hair turns to you. "Seventy-five percent. And they wonder why we can barely afford nutrient paste."

You notice their eyes darting across the contract at incredible speed, actually reading it. Pattern recognition, maybe? Or hyperlexia?

### Choice Point 2: The Terms

The contract hovers, waiting for your thumbprint. What do you do?

[Choices as defined in metadata]

## Meeting Your First Partner

After the bureaucratic gauntlet, you're directed to Partner Assignment. The room is filled with people who don't quite fit the corporate mold—some pace in perfect patterns, others stare intensely at nothing, a few engage in repetitive movements that seem to calm them.

"Society's rejects," someone says beside you. Kai Chen, according to their badge, watches the room with calculating eyes. "That's what they call us. But look closer."

They gesture to a woman rapidly solving a routing puzzle that stumped three others. "Hyperfocus. That guy there? He noticed a pattern in delivery schedules that saves 20 minutes per route. The Algorithm can't replicate what we do naturally."

"They exploit what makes us different," Kai continues. "But maybe that's also how we beat them."

### Your First Partner

The assignment system pairs you with [Name varies based on player choices], whose [trait] immediately stands out. They extend a hand—or don't, depending on their sensory preferences.

"Guess we're partners now," they say. "Fair warning: I don't do small talk, I eat the same lunch every day, and I will absolutely info-dump about my special interest in pre-WHIX urban architecture. That cool with you?"

## The Tutorial Mission

Your first delivery seems simple: transport a package from Point A to Point B. But this is Neo Prosperity, where simple doesn't exist.

The rain has turned the streets into rivers of neon reflections. Your partner's enhanced senses pick up things you miss—a surveillance drone's hum, the pattern of police patrols, the safest route through the chaos.

"First lesson," your partner says, navigating with uncanny precision. "WHIX tracks everything—speed, route efficiency, customer interaction time. But they designed their system for neurotypical patterns. We're glitches in their matrix."

### The Twist

Halfway through the delivery, your partner freezes. "Something's wrong. This package... the weight distribution is off."

Inside, instead of the listed electronics, you find medical supplies. Insulin. The address? A quarantined district where WHIX doesn't deliver.

"Shit," your partner breathes. "This is underground railroad stuff. Someone's using WHIX's own system against them."

### Choice Point 3: The Moral Dilemma

What do you do with the medical supplies?

1. **Complete the Real Delivery** - Help people who need it
   - +15 Humanity
   - Unlock rebel contact
   - Risk corporate suspicion

2. **Report to WHIX** - Follow the rules
   - -20 Humanity  
   - +500 tip bonus
   - Partner trust decreases

3. **Investigate Further** - Try to learn who's behind this
   - Unlock investigation subplot
   - Gain valuable intel
   - Delay increases risk

## Chapter Conclusion

Back at your pod that night, the day's events replay in your mind. The city's neon glow filters through your single window, painting everything in shades of corporate dystopia.

Your partner's words echo: "We're glitches in their matrix."

Maybe that's exactly what Neo Prosperity needs.

Your WHIX device pings with tomorrow's assignments. The tip count is pathetic after the company's cut, but something else has value now—knowledge that the system isn't as absolute as it seems.

In this city of algorithms and optimization, being different isn't just an adaptation.

It's a revolution waiting to happen.
