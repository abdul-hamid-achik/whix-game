      [Miguel's neural interface crackles with static. A message notification appears - from Tania]
      
      The text is garbled, corrupted: "M1gu3l... h0w... @re... y0u...?"
      
      Before he can respond, the device screams with feedback. Sparks fly from the neural ports. The screen goes dead.
      
      WHIX-AI: "CRITICAL ERROR. UNAUTHORIZED COMMUNICATION ATTEMPT DETECTED. DEVICE LOCKDOWN INITIATED."

    description: |
      Central Square throbs with angry voices. What started as an organized protest about the random curfews has devolved into chaos. 
      
      Main protesters hold signs: "CONSISTENT CURFEW TIMES NOW!" and "STOP THE RANDOM LOCKDOWNS!"
      
      But scattered throughout, other voices create a cacophony:
      "MY NEIGHBOR'S DOG IS TOO LOUD!"
      "BRING BACK REAL COCA-COLA!"
      "THE PIGEONS ARE GOVERNMENT DRONES!"
      
      The legitimate message drowns in the noise. Miguel realizes he needs to navigate this mess to find Father Santiago - and fix his device to respond to Tania.

      Near an overturned WHIX delivery cart, a young man has set up an impromptu repair station. His movements are precise, repetitive - he disassembles and reassembles devices without looking, hands moving in perfect patterns.
      
      "Don't touch anything," he says without looking up. "Your neural interface is broadcasting distress signals. Corporate malware triggered by unauthorized communication. Seen it twelve times today. Pattern suggests coordinated suppression."
      
      His workspace is organized chaos - parts sorted by function, size, and failure probability. Classic signs of systemizing thinking.
      
      "Ricardo Morales. 'Tech' to everyone. I can fix your device, but you'll owe me. Not tips - information. Why did WHIX burn out your comms trying to stop that message?"

      Father Santiago is nothing like Mendoza. His robes are patched, worn. His eyes are kind but tired. He's distributing actual food - not synthetic proteins - to protesters.
      
      "You have my package? Ah, medical supplies. The real kind, not WHIX-approved placebos."
      
      He hands you a credit chip with an enormous tip.
      
      "I know who you are, Miguel. Tania spoke of you before... before they took her mind. I'm not with the Cathedral's corruption. Some of us remember what faith meant before the merger."
      
      He leans closer.
      
      "The random curfews? They're testing response patterns. The Labyrinthine District's unique layout makes it perfect for behavioral experiments. They want to see how chaos affects productivity, how unpredictability breaks community bonds."

      Tania: "No! The Festival... it's not just the Cathedral District. They're going to harvest everyone. The white nationalists in Nuevo Polanco, they think they're exempt, but Chen's playing them too."
      
      [Static increases]
      
      Tania: "The curfew chaos... it's to break community solidarity. Isolated people are easier to harvest. The Labyrinthine District is the test case. If they can control that neighborhood's resistance..."
      
      Miguel: "Tania, fight the conditioning!"
      
      Tania: "I am fighting! But Miguel... what if the patterns I see are real? What if our neurodivergence isn't just different, but evolution? What if they're harvesting us because we're the future they fear?"

      Corporate enforcement arrives in force. The protest is about to turn violent. Father Santiago grabs your arm.
      
      "This is what they want - chaos, violence, justification for martial law. But there's another way. Help me lead these people to safety through the Labyrinthine District's hidden paths."
      
      Ricardo objects: "Or we could broadcast the truth! I can hack their announcement system, tell everyone about the neural harvesting!"

        Father Santiago's knowledge of old pilgrimage routes proves invaluable. You lead protesters through forgotten passages, away from corporate forces.
        
        "Faith without works is dead," he says, helping an elderly woman through a narrow alley. "And work without faith is slavery. Remember that, Miguel."
        
        The protest disperses safely, but the underlying issues remain. The random curfews continue, the community bonds fray, and somewhere, Tania fights a battle in her own mind.
        
        Ricardo joins your team, impressed by the peaceful resolution. "Patterns of compassion," he muses. "More complex than code."
        
      digital_resistance: |
        Ricardo's fingers fly across improvised interfaces. Suddenly, every screen in Central Square displays the same message:
        
        "WHIX HARVESTS NEURODIVERGENT MINDS. THE FESTIVAL IS A LIE. YOUR THOUGHTS ARE THE PRODUCT."
        
        The revelation sparks panic and rage. Some protesters attack corporate property, others flee in terror. The chaos provides cover for many to escape, but also justification for a harsh crackdown.
        
        "Truth has a price," Ricardo says, watching enforcement drones descend. "But lies cost more in the end."
        
        He joins your team, committed to digital rebellion.
        
      selfish_search: |
        You abandon the protesters to their fate, using the chaos to access restricted corporate terminals.
        
        What you find chills you: Tania is scheduled for "Final Optimization" in 48 hours. The process is irreversible - complete neural upload, leaving only a biological shell.
        
        But your selfish choice has consequences. Without leadership, the protest turns violent. Father Santiago is arrested trying to protect others. The corporate crackdown is swift and brutal.
        
        Ricardo refuses to join you. "You showed your pattern," he says coldly. "It's incompatible with mine."
        
        You have information, but at the cost of community trust and potential allies.

# Chapter 3: The Broken Signal

The message from Tania arrives like a ghost in the machine - distorted, desperate, and immediately suppressed by WHIX's security protocols.

As Miguel's neural interface sparks and dies, he's thrust into a brewing storm at Central Square. A protest about random curfews has become a chaotic symphony of grievances, and somewhere in this mess, a mysterious priest waits with answers.

But first, Miguel needs to fix his device, decode Tania's warning, and navigate a crowd where legitimate resistance mixes with manufactured chaos - all while the clock ticks toward something called "Final Optimization."

In the margins of society, where the Labyrinthine District meets the corporate core, the true shape of WHIX's experiment begins to emerge. And Miguel must decide: Is solidarity worth more than answers? Is community stronger than code?

The signal is broken, but perhaps that's where the truth hides - in the static between corporate control and human connection.
