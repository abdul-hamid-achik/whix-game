      [Miguel's neural interface crackles with static. A message notification appears - from Tania]
      
      The text is garbled, corrupted: "M1gu3l... h0w... @re... y0u...?"
      
      Before he can respond, the device screams with feedback. Sparks fly from the neural ports. The screen goes dead.

    description: |
      The Zócalo throbs with angry voices beneath the massive statue of Cuauhtémoc holding a neural interface instead of a spear. What started as an organized protest about the random curfews has devolved into chaos. 
      
      Main protesters hold signs: "¡HORARIOS DE TOQUE DE QUEDA CONSISTENTES YA!" and "¡PAREN LOS CIERRES ALEATORIOS!"
      
      But scattered throughout, other voices create a cacophony:
      "¡EL PERRO DE MI VECINO HACE MUCHO RUIDO!"
      "¡QUEREMOS COCA-COLA REAL, NO SINTÉTICA!"
      "¡LAS PALOMAS SON DRONES DEL GOBIERNO!"
      
      The legitimate message drowns in the noise. Miguel realizes he needs to navigate this mess to find Padre Santiago - and fix his device to respond to Tania.

      Near an overturned WHIX delivery cart, a young man has set up an impromptu repair station. His movements are precise, repetitive - he disassembles and reassembles devices without looking, hands moving in perfect patterns. But there's something desperate in his efficiency.
      
      "Don't touch anything," he says without looking up. "Your neural interface is broadcasting distress signals. Corporate malware triggered by unauthorized communication. Seen it twelve times today. Pattern suggests coordinated suppression."
      
      His workspace is organized chaos - parts sorted by function, size, and failure probability. But Miguel notices a small photo tucked behind the circuit boards: a young boy, maybe eight, with the same intense focus as Ricardo.
      
      "Ricardo Morales. 'Tech' to everyone. I can fix your device, but you'll owe me. Not tips - information. Why did WHIX burn out your comms trying to stop that message?"
      
      Miguel: "Someone I care about is in trouble. What's with the picture?"
      
      Ricardo: [His hands pause for a microsecond] "My nephew. Tomás. He's like me - sees patterns in everything, remembers every detail. His mom thinks it's just 'being smart.' She doesn't understand that WHIX has been tracking kids like him since kindergarten."
      
      [He continues working, but there's emotion in his voice now]
      
      Ricardo: "They call it 'early cognitive assessment.' But I've seen the data. They're building recruitment pipelines, starting with children. Tomás scored in the 99th percentile for pattern recognition. He'll be on their priority list in ten years."
      
      Miguel: "That's why you're helping people?"
      
      Ricardo: "That's why I'm learning everything about their systems. Every device I fix, every malware signature I catalog, every security protocol I crack - it's all preparation. When they come for him, I'll be ready."

      Father Santiago is nothing like Mendoza. His robes are patched, worn, and smell like cooking oil and incense. His weathered hands distribute actual food - beans, rice, tortillas - not synthetic proteins. This is a priest who knows hunger.
      
      "¿Tienes mi paquete, mijo? Ah, medical supplies. The real kind, not WHIX-approved placebos."
      
      He presses a credit chip into Miguel's hand along with a warm tamale wrapped in foil.
      
      "I know who you are, Miguel Santos. Tania spoke of you before... before they took her beautiful mind. She said you were like her - someone who sees patterns others miss."
      
      He leans closer, his voice dropping to street-level Spanish mixed with English.
      
      "Listen, hermano. The random curfews? They're testing response patterns. Esta gente in the Labyrinthine District, they're like lab rats in a maze. WHIX wants to see how chaos affects productivity, how unpredictability breaks community bonds."
      
      [He gestures to the protesters around them]
      
      "My grandmother always said 'La unión hace la fuerza' - unity makes strength. But you can't have unity when nobody knows what time curfew is, when families can't plan, when neighbors can't trust each other to be home."

      Tania: "No! The Festival... it's not just the Cathedral District. They're going to harvest everyone. The white nationalists in Nuevo Polanco, they think they're exempt, but Chen's playing them too."
      
      [Static increases]
      
      Tania: "The curfew chaos... it's to break community solidarity. Isolated people are easier to harvest. The Labyrinthine District is the test case. If they can control that neighborhood's resistance..."
      
      Miguel: "Tania, fight the conditioning!"
      
      Tania: "I am fighting! But Miguel... what if the patterns I see are real? What if our neurodivergence isn't just different, but evolution? What if they're harvesting us because we're the future they fear?"

        Father Santiago's knowledge of old pilgrimage routes proves invaluable. You lead protesters through forgotten passages, away from corporate forces.
        
        "Faith without works is dead," he says, helping an elderly woman through a narrow alley. "And work without faith is slavery. Remember that, Miguel."
        
        The protest disperses safely, but the underlying issues remain. The random curfews continue, the community bonds fray, and somewhere, Tania fights a battle in her own mind.
        
        Ricardo joins your team, impressed by the peaceful resolution. "Patterns of compassion," he muses. "More complex than code."
        
      digital_resistance: |
        Ricardo's fingers fly across improvised interfaces. Suddenly, every screen in Central Square displays the same message:
        
        "WHIX HARVESTS NEURODIVERGENT MINDS. THE FESTIVAL IS A LIE. YOUR THOUGHTS ARE THE PRODUCT."
        
        The revelation sparks panic and rage. Some protesters attack corporate property, others flee in terror. The chaos provides cover for many to escape, but also justification for a harsh crackdown.
        
        "Truth has a price," Ricardo says, watching enforcement drones descend. "But lies cost more in the end."
        
        He joins your team, committed to digital rebellion.
        
      selfish_search: |
        You abandon the protesters to their fate, using the chaos to access restricted corporate terminals.
        
        What you find chills you: Tania is scheduled for "Final Optimization" in 48 hours. The process is irreversible - complete neural upload, leaving only a biological shell.
        
        But your selfish choice has consequences. Without leadership, the protest turns violent. Father Santiago is arrested trying to protect others. The corporate crackdown is swift and brutal.
        
        Ricardo refuses to join you. "You showed your pattern," he says coldly. "It's incompatible with mine."
        
        You have information, but at the cost of community trust and potential allies.

# Chapter 3: The Broken Signal

The message from Tania arrives like a ghost in the machine - distorted, desperate, and immediately suppressed by WHIX's security protocols.

As Miguel's neural interface sparks and dies, he's thrust into a brewing storm at Central Square. A protest about random curfews has become a chaotic symphony of grievances, and somewhere in this mess, a mysterious priest waits with answers.

But first, Miguel needs to fix his device, decode Tania's warning, and navigate a crowd where legitimate resistance mixes with manufactured chaos - all while the clock ticks toward something called "Final Optimization."

In the margins of society, where the Labyrinthine District meets the corporate core, the true shape of WHIX's experiment begins to emerge. And Miguel must decide: Is solidarity worth more than answers? Is community stronger than code?

The signal is broken, but perhaps that's where the truth hides - in the static between corporate control and human connection.
