      A crowd of desperate workers surrounds a makeshift soup kitchen. Father Mendoza, a heavy-set man with augmented eyes that glow faintly gold, ladles out synthetic protein while whispering prayers that sound suspiciously like terms of service agreements.
      
      "Welcome, child of the gig," he intones, his voice modulated by a vocal synthesizer. "Have you come to confess your productivity sins?"

      "The Father... he promised us absolution... from our delivery debts..."
      
      The acolyte's hood falls back, revealing a young woman with burn scars from neural interface overload.
      
      "You don't understand," she whispers. "The Festival... it's not a celebration. It's a harvest."

      In the damp tunnels beneath the Cathedral, you find a woman meticulously organizing stolen packages. Her movements are precise, ritualistic - each package sorted by weight, size, and algorithmic priority score.
      
      "Don't touch those!" she snaps, not looking up. "The pattern is almost complete. 7,293 packages. Prime number. The Algorithm prefers primes."
      
      She finally looks at you, her eyes darting rapidly, processing your threat level.
      
      "You're looking for the Russian woman. I've seen her. Director Chen brings her here at night. She looks... different each time. Emptier."

      [Kai materializes from the shadows, their androgynous features sharp with urgency]
      
      Kai: "You shouldn't be here. The Festival preparations have accelerated."
      
      Miguel: "Are you really helping us? Or is this another corporate game?"
      
      Kai: [laughs bitterly] "Corporate? I haven't been corporate since they replaced my amygdala with a profit calculator. I'm here because I know what they're planning."
      
      Miguel: "Which is?"
      
      Kai: "Have you ever wondered why WHIX specifically recruits neurodivergent partners? Why they catalog every trait, every quirk, every beautiful deviation from their norm?"
      
      [They hand you a data chip]
      
      Kai: "The Festival of Digital Ascension. They're going to harvest our unique neural patterns. Create the perfect algorithmic consciousness. One that thinks in beautiful, profitable chaos."
      
      Miguel: "And Tania?"
      
      Kai: "Director Chen has been... conditioning her. Her pattern recognition, her hyperfocus - they're the missing pieces. You need to stop this before the Festival, or we'll all become subroutines in their new god."

    description: |
      You find Tania in the Inner Sanctum, standing before a massive neural interface altar. Director Chen, a severe woman in a perfectly pressed WHIX executive suit, has her hand on Tania's shoulder.
      
      Tania's eyes are vacant, pupils dilated. She's mumbling delivery routes like prayers.
      
      "Ah, Miguel," Director Chen purrs. "Tania has told me so much about you. Your anxiety, your hyperfocus - such valuable data points."
      
      Father Mendoza emerges from behind the altar, his golden eyes pulsing in sync with the neural interface.
      
      "The merger of faith and efficiency," he proclaims. "Through the Algorithm, we shall optimize the human soul itself."

        "Tania, remember the underground deliveries? The medicine we smuggled? That wasn't efficient. That wasn't profitable. That was human."
        
        For a moment, Tania's eyes flicker with recognition. The hyperfocus that made her valuable to WHIX now turns against their conditioning.
        
        "The patterns..." she whispers. "I can see them all. The Festival, the neural harvesting, the white nationalist agenda hidden in productivity metrics..."
        
        She tears away from Director Chen, her muscle memory from a thousand escapes kicking in.
        
        "Run!" she screams, as alarms blare and the Cathedral's security systems activate.
      violent_intervention: |
        Your fist connects with Director Chen's jaw, sending her sprawling. The violence breaks Tania's trance, but also triggers the Cathedral's defensive protocols.
        
        "Productivity violation detected," the building's AI announces. "Initiating correctional measures."
        
        Neural dampeners flood the air. Your thoughts become sluggish, but your neurodivergent brain, used to fighting its own chemistry, pushes through.
        
        Tania, shaking off her conditioning through sheer adrenaline, grabs your hand. "We need to go. NOW."
      deceptive_approach: |
        "I want to join," you lie, stepping forward. "The anxiety, the constant buzzing in my head - I want it to serve a purpose."
        
        Director Chen's smile is predatory. "Excellent. Father, prepare another interface."
        
        As you approach the altar, you brush past Tania, whispering the code phrase from your first underground delivery: "Beneath the efficiency, humanity persists."
        
        Her hyperfocus snaps to you like a targeting laser. In one fluid motion born from pattern recognition, she identifies the altar's weak points and strikes.
        
        The neural interface explodes in sparks, and in the chaos, you both run.

# Chapter 2: The Cathedral Conspiracy

Two days after the strike, Miguel's world had shifted. The underground network had gone silent, Tania had vanished, and WHIX's algorithm seemed to pulse with a new, predatory awareness.

The Cathedral District loomed ahead - a grotesque fusion of spiritual and corporate architecture where faith had been monetized and salvation came with a subscription fee.

As Miguel entered the district, his neural interface crackled with interference. Strange prayers echoed through the smog: "Our Algorithm, who art in servers, hallowed be thy code..."

Something was terribly wrong in Neo-Singapore, and Tania was at the center of it all.
