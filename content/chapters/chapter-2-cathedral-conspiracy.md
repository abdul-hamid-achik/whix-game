      [Miguel's neural interface receives an encrypted message, bypassing WHIX monitoring]
      
      Tania: [Audio only, distorted] "Miguel, if you're getting this, I've activated the dead man's switch I built into my interface."
      
      Miguel: [Whispering] "Tania? Where are you? I've been trying to reach you for two days."
      
      Tania: "They're moving me to 'special assignments.' The Cathedral District thing is a cover. Miguel, I've been tracking their data collection patterns during our deliveries. It's not random."
      
      [Background sounds - footsteps, corporate announcements]
      
      Tania: "They're mapping neural activity in real-time. Every time we experience empathy, anxiety, pattern recognition... they're measuring it, quantifying it. Building profiles of how our brains work under stress."
      
      Miguel: "Tania, you're scaring me."
      
      Tania: "Good. Be scared. But more importantly, be careful. They've been conditioning us gradually - the delivery routes, the crisis situations, the moral choices. Everything's designed to test and train our responses."
      
      [Signal degrades]
      
      Tania: "I'm going dark after this. If they contact you about partnering with someone new, don't trust them. The Festival... it's not what they're saying it is. Miguel, promise me—"
      
      [Connection terminates]
      
      WHIX-ITZTLI: [Suddenly active] "Error de conexión detectado. La Compañera Volkov no está disponible actualmente. Se están procesando asignaciones de compañerismo alternativo."

      [Miguel arrives at the hub, desperate for information about Tania's disappearance]
      
      Miguel: "I need to know where Tania Volkov is. She's my partner."
      
      WHIX-ITZTLI: "La Compañera Volkov ha sido reasignada al Distrito de la Catedral para preparaciones del Festival. Sus métricas de productividad mostraron potencial de optimización que requería... atención especializada."
      
      Miguel: "Optimization potential? What does that mean?"
      
      WHIX-ITZTLI: "La Fiesta de la Ascensión Digital representa la siguiente evolución en la integración humano-algoritmo. Compañeros seleccionados con patrones neurales excepcionales demostrarán el mejoramiento voluntario de la conciencia."
      
      [The AI's tone carries mechanical reverence, like a prayer recorded and played back through serpent speakers]
      
      Miguel: "Voluntary? She didn't volunteer for anything."
      
      WHIX-ITZTLI: "Todos los compañeros consienten a oportunidades de optimización al momento del empleo. Revise su contrato, sección 47-B: Protocolos de Desarrollo y Mejoramiento Neural. Su asistencia al Festival es... encouraged."

      The Templo de la Nueva Evangelización looms before you—a massive fusion of Soviet brutalism and Aztec pyramid architecture. Its concrete steps are carved with reliefs of digital angels bearing hammer-and-sickle halos, while surveillance cameras nestle between obsidian serpent heads. Holographic saints flicker in the smog, their faces replaced with WHIX efficiency metrics and corporate productivity charts.
      
      A crowd of desperate workers surrounds a makeshift comedor popular. Padre Mendoza, a heavy-set man with augmented eyes that glow faintly gold, ladles out synthetic protein paste while whispering prayers that sound suspiciously like production quotas.
      
      "Bienvenido, hijo del trabajo," he intones, his voice modulated by a vocal synthesizer that adds undertones of Nahuatl chanting. "¿Has venido a confesar tus pecados de productividad?"

      The defeated thief coughs up blood mixed with communion wine.
      
      "The Father... he promised us absolution... from our delivery debts..."
      
      The acolyte's hood falls back, revealing a young woman with burn scars from neural interface overload.
      
      "You don't understand," she whispers. "The Festival... it's not a celebration. It's a harvest."

    description: |
      In the damp tunnels beneath the Cathedral, you find a woman meticulously organizing stolen packages. Her movements are precise, ritualistic - each package sorted by weight, size, and algorithmic priority score. But something about her organization feels wrong, like she's fighting against her own nature.
      
      "Don't touch those!" she snaps, not looking up. "The pattern is almost complete. 7,293 packages. Prime number. The Algorithm prefers primes."
      
      She finally looks at you, her eyes darting rapidly, processing your threat level. There's intelligence there, but also exhaustion.
      
      Miguel: "You're organizing stolen packages. Why?"
      
      Isabella: [Bitter laugh] "Stolen? These aren't stolen. They're misdirected. I used to work for WHIX Corporate - data analysis division. My job was pattern recognition in delivery networks."
      
      [She continues sorting, but her movements become more agitated]
      
      Isabella: "I saw the patterns they didn't want me to see. Medical deliveries delayed to specific addresses. Mental health medications 'accidentally' routed to surveillance districts. Emergency supplies diverted from families with neurodivergent children."
      
      Miguel: "They were targeting people through delivery manipulation?"
      
      Isabella: "Worse. They were creating crisis conditions to justify intervention. Make someone's medication late, track their stress responses, offer corporate mental health services. Make emergency supplies disappear, then offer corporate emergency loans with neural monitoring requirements."
      
      [She shows Miguel her arm - scarred from neural interface removal]
      
      Isabella: "When I tried to report it, they decided I was having 'pattern recognition dysfunction' and needed optimization. I removed my corporate interface with a kitchen knife rather than let them reprogram my mind."
      
      Miguel: "Jesus. How do you organize all this without going crazy?"
      
      Isabella: "Who says I haven't? I sort packages by pattern because it's the only way to make sense of chaos. 7,293 stolen deliveries, each one representing someone's suffering. Prime numbers don't lie. Prime numbers can't be manipulated."
      
      [She looks directly at Miguel for the first time]
      
      Isabella: "You're looking for the Russian woman. Tania. I've seen her. Director Chen brings her here at night for 'field optimization tests.' She looks... different each time. Emptier. Like they're deleting pieces of her mind."

      [Kai materializes from the shadows, their androgynous features sharp with urgency]
      
      Kai: "You shouldn't be here. The Festival preparations have accelerated."
      
      Miguel: "Are you really helping us? Or is this another corporate game?"
      
      Kai: [laughs bitterly] "Corporate? I haven't been corporate since they replaced my amygdala with a profit calculator. I'm here because I know what they're planning."
      
      Miguel: "Which is?"
      
      Kai: "Have you ever wondered why WHIX specifically recruits neurodivergent partners? Why they catalog every trait, every quirk, every beautiful deviation from their norm?"
      
      [They hand you a data chip]
      
      Kai: "The Festival of Digital Ascension. They're going to harvest our unique neural patterns. Create the perfect algorithmic consciousness. One that thinks in beautiful, profitable chaos."
      
      Miguel: "And Tania?"
      
      Kai: "Director Chen has been... conditioning her. Her pattern recognition, her hyperfocus - they're the missing pieces. You need to stop this before the Festival, or we'll all become subroutines in their new god."

    description: |
      You find Tania in the Inner Sanctum, standing before a massive neural interface altar. Director Chen, a severe woman in a perfectly pressed WHIX executive suit, has her hand on Tania's shoulder.
      
      Tania's eyes are vacant, pupils dilated. She's mumbling delivery routes like prayers.
      
      "Ah, Miguel," Director Chen purrs. "Tania has told me so much about you. Your anxiety, your hyperfocus - such valuable data points."
      
      Father Mendoza emerges from behind the altar, his golden eyes pulsing in sync with the neural interface.
      
      "The merger of faith and efficiency," he proclaims. "Through the Algorithm, we shall optimize the human soul itself."

        "Tania, remember the underground deliveries? The medicine we smuggled? That wasn't efficient. That wasn't profitable. That was human."
        
        For a moment, Tania's eyes flicker with recognition. The hyperfocus that made her valuable to WHIX now turns against their conditioning.
        
        "The patterns..." she whispers. "I can see them all. The Festival, the neural harvesting, the white nationalist agenda hidden in productivity metrics..."
        
        She tears away from Director Chen, her muscle memory from a thousand escapes kicking in.
        
        "Run!" she screams, as alarms blare and the Cathedral's security systems activate.
      violent_intervention: |
        Your fist connects with Director Chen's jaw, sending her sprawling. The violence breaks Tania's trance, but also triggers the Cathedral's defensive protocols.
        
        "Productivity violation detected," the building's AI announces. "Initiating correctional measures."
        
        Neural dampeners flood the air. Your thoughts become sluggish, but your neurodivergent brain, used to fighting its own chemistry, pushes through.
        
        Tania, shaking off her conditioning through sheer adrenaline, grabs your hand. "We need to go. NOW."
      deceptive_approach: |
        "I want to join," you lie, stepping forward. "The anxiety, the constant buzzing in my head - I want it to serve a purpose."
        
        Director Chen's smile is predatory. "Excellent. Father, prepare another interface."
        
        As you approach the altar, you brush past Tania, whispering the code phrase from your first underground delivery: "Beneath the efficiency, humanity persists."
        
        Her hyperfocus snaps to you like a targeting laser. In one fluid motion born from pattern recognition, she identifies the altar's weak points and strikes.
        
        The neural interface explodes in sparks, and in the chaos, you both run.

# Chapter 2: The Cathedral Conspiracy

Two days after the strike, Miguel's world had shifted. The underground network had gone silent, Tania had vanished, and WHIX's algorithm seemed to pulse with a new, predatory awareness.

The Cathedral District loomed ahead - a grotesque fusion of spiritual and corporate architecture where faith had been monetized and salvation came with a subscription fee.

As Miguel entered the district, his neural interface crackled with interference. Strange prayers echoed through the smog: "Our Algorithm, who art in servers, hallowed be thy code..."

Something was terribly wrong in the capital, and Tania was at the center of it all.
