# Tlacoyos con Nopales

## Description

These boat-shaped corn cakes are among Mexico's oldest fast foods, predating the conquest by centuries. Made from blue or white corn masa, stuffed with refried beans or fava beans, then griddled until crispy. Topped with grilled nopales (cactus paddles), fresh cheese, and your choice of salsa.

## Gameplay Effect

The combination of complex carbs, plant protein, and the unique properties of nopales make this an ideal meal for drivers dealing with high-stress routes. The cactus provides natural anti-inflammatory compounds that reduce fatigue accumulation during long shifts.

## Historical Note

In the WHIX universe, tlacoyos represent unbroken tradition. The women who make them in the markets learned from their grandmothers, who learned from theirs, in an unbroken chain that predates both the Algorithm and the corporations by millennia.
