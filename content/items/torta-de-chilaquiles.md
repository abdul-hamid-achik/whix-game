# Torta de Chilaquiles

## Description

A Mexico City innovation that defies culinary logic - taking already perfect chilaquiles (fried tortilla chips in salsa) and stuffing them inside a torta roll with refried beans, cheese, and crema. It's messy, it's excessive, and it's absolutely delicious.

## Gameplay Effect

While the heavy meal temporarily reduces movement speed, the satisfaction boost improves customer interactions. Drivers who show up with chilaquiles on their breath are recognized as true chilangos, earning instant street cred.

## Origin Story

Legend says this creation emerged from a hungover taquero who couldn't decide between chilaquiles and a torta for breakfast. In WHIX's timeline, it became the unofficial meal of resistance - too chaotic for the Algorithm to categorize or optimize.

## Preparation Tips

- Green salsa variant provides alertness
- Red salsa variant offers warmth in cold weather
- Add egg for protein boost
- Milanesa option for extreme hunger

## Locations

- **Tortas Don Polo** - Best traditional version
- **El Cuadrilátero** - Wrestling-themed variants
- **Morning street stalls** - Near Metro Pino Suárez
- **La Esquina del Chilaquil** - 24/7 operation
