lore: |
  Ekaterina spent two years reverse-engineering corporate surveillance systems, learning how WHIX tracks and profiles every citizen. This device represents the culmination of her work - a perfect defense against data collection built from the very technology meant to surveil.
  
  "They think our lives are data to be harvested," she says, soldering the final circuit. "This proves our privacy can't be owned, can't be tracked, can't be sold. Every jammer is an act of revolution."
  
  The device uses quantum interference patterns to create "data static" - random signals that mask the user's true behavioral patterns. To corporate surveillance systems, a jammer user appears as an empty void, a glitch in their matrix of data collection.
  
  Each unit is hand-built using components salvaged from corporate facilities, modified with analog circuits that resist digital intrusion. The irony is deliberate - corporate surveillance tools transformed into liberation technology.

historicalSignificance: |
  The neural scrambler represents a turning point in the resistance movement. Before Ekaterina's invention, corporate mind reading made organized resistance nearly impossible. Thoughts could be extracted, plans discovered, allies identified.
  
  The first successful test came when Vera escaped a neural harvesting session, her thoughts protected by an early prototype. The corporate technicians found only static where her memories should have been.
  
  Since then, scramblers have enabled the resistance to plan operations, protect intelligence, and maintain hidden networks. They're symbols of cognitive sovereignty - proof that human thoughts can remain free even under total surveillance.

# Ekaterina's Neural Scrambler: The Liberation Device

In the war for human consciousness, Ekaterina's Neural Scrambler stands as the ultimate weapon of cognitive sovereignty. Built from stolen corporate technology and powered by revolutionary determination, it transforms the oppressed into the invisible.

## Revolutionary Engineering

### Quantum Interference Technology
The scrambler generates precisely calibrated quantum static that makes neural scanning impossible. Corporate scanners encounter an empty void where the user's thoughts should be, as if the person simply doesn't exist on the mental spectrum.

### Adaptive Counter-Surveillance
The device learns and adapts to new corporate scanning methods automatically. As WHIX develops new neural intrusion technology, the scrambler evolves to counter it, staying one step ahead of oppression.

### Resistance Network Integration
Multiple scramblers can link together to create larger zones of protection, enabling resistance meetings and operations in areas that should be under total surveillance.

## Symbol of Cognitive Freedom

### From Oppression to Liberation
Every component was once part of the surveillance apparatus designed to enslave minds. Ekaterina's genius lies in turning corporate technology against itself, creating freedom from the very tools of tyranny.

### Proof of Concept
The scrambler proves that human consciousness cannot be fully dominated by technology. No matter how advanced corporate neural harvesting becomes, the human mind can create countermeasures.

### Catalyst for Resistance
Knowing that their thoughts are truly private for the first time in years, resistance members can plan, hope, and dream without fear. The psychological impact is as powerful as the technological protection.

## Gameplay Significance

### High-Stakes Equipment
The scrambler makes the player a priority target for corporate forces while enabling access to the most dangerous and important resistance missions.

### Trust and Loyalty Reward
Receiving the device represents Ekaterina's complete trust - earned through multiple acts of resistance and proof of dedication to liberation over personal safety.

### Strategic Advantage
Beyond protection, the scrambler provides access to resistance intelligence networks and hidden resources unavailable to unprotected individuals.

## The Price of Freedom

### Corporate Enemy Status
Using a neural scrambler marks the player as a high-priority threat to corporate control. Surveillance increases, corporate agents actively hunt for the device, and capture attempts become more aggressive.

### Responsibility Burden
The scrambler's rarity means every user carries responsibility for resistance operations that depend on neural protection. Losing the device could doom entire networks.

### Target for Innovation
Corporate forces constantly work to counter scrambler technology, making ongoing upgrades and adaptations necessary for continued protection.

In Ekaterina's Neural Scrambler, players hold more than advanced technology - they carry the physical embodiment of the resistance's core belief that human thoughts must remain free, that consciousness cannot be owned, and that liberation is always possible for those brave enough to fight for it.
