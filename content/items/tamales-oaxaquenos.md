# Tamales Oaxaqueños

## Description

Wrapped in aromatic banana leaves instead of corn husks, these Oaxacan-style tamales are filled with complex mole negro and tender chicken. The masa is enriched with lard and chicken stock, creating a texture that's both firm and yielding. A breakfast that has fueled Mexico City's workers for generations.

## Gameplay Effect

The high caloric content and warming properties make these perfect for early morning delivery shifts. The complex carbs provide sustained energy release, while the protein helps maintain focus during long routes.

## Cultural Significance

In WHIX's Mexico City, the tamaleros still ride their modified bicycles through the neighborhoods at dawn, their steam pots jury-rigged with GPS trackers to avoid Algorithm enforcement. The cry of "¡TAMALES!" remains one of the few human sounds that pierce the corporate surveillance network.
