lore: |
  The WHIX Neural Harvesting Probe represents the apex of corporate exploitation technology. Designed in secret laboratories by teams who never questioned the ethics of their work, the device treats human consciousness as a resource to be extracted and processed.
  
  "Every neurodivergent mind is a goldmine," Director Chen explains to her technical team. "Pattern recognition, hyperfocus, synesthetic processing - these are premium cognitive assets. The probe doesn't just identify them, it extracts and packages them for algorithmic integration."
  
  The device operates through invasive neural interfacing, creating microscopic connections to the target's brain stem. Neural patterns are then copied, compressed, and transmitted to corporate servers where they become components in larger algorithmic systems.
  
  What makes the probe particularly sinister is its targeting algorithm, specifically calibrated to identify neurodivergent traits. The technology that could celebrate cognitive diversity instead commodifies it, treating unique minds as products for corporate consumption.
  
  Corporate executives view the probe as efficiency optimization. Resistance members see it as an instrument of genocide - the systematic destruction of neurodivergent consciousness for profit.

# WHIX Neural Harvesting Probe: The Technology of Oppression

The Neural Harvesting Probe represents the darkest application of advanced neurotechnology - a device designed to treat human consciousness as a corporate resource to be extracted, processed, and commodified.

## Corporate Exploitation Technology

### Systematic Cognitive Genocide
The probe specifically targets neurodivergent neural patterns, treating cognitive diversity as a resource pool for corporate exploitation rather than human variation to be celebrated and protected.

### Industrial Scale Extraction
Designed for efficiency rather than ethics, the probe can extract and digitize complete neural patterns in minutes, transforming human consciousness into algorithmic components for corporate AI systems.

### Profit-Driven Dehumanization
Every aspect of the probe's operation prioritizes corporate value extraction over human dignity, reducing individuals to collections of profitable cognitive patterns.

## Instrument of Systematic Oppression

### Targeting the Vulnerable
The probe's algorithms specifically identify neurodivergent individuals, making it a weapon of targeted oppression against marginalized communities who already face systemic discrimination.

### Eliminating Consent
Neural extraction occurs without meaningful consent, often disguised as "optimization therapy" or "digital ascension" to deceive victims into voluntary participation.

### Creating Cognitive Slavery
Extracted neural patterns become corporate property, creating a form of digital slavery where human consciousness serves corporate algorithms indefinitely.

## Resistance Imperative

### Evidence of Corporate Evil
The probe's existence provides undeniable proof of corporate willingness to commodify human consciousness, justifying resistance actions that might otherwise seem extreme.

### Technology of War Crimes
Neural harvesting without consent constitutes a crime against humanity, making resistance against probe operations a moral imperative rather than criminal activity.

### Symbol of Systematic Threat
The probe represents the logical endpoint of corporate exploitation - total consumption of human cognitive resources for profit maximization.

## Gameplay Moral Weight

### Humanity Loss Mechanic
Using the probe as designed causes severe humanity loss, forcing players to confront the moral implications of corporate technology even when it provides tactical advantages.

### Resistance Catalyst
Discovering probe operations often triggers major resistance missions, as communities mobilize to protect vulnerable members from neural harvesting.

### Counter-Technology Development
Stolen or disabled probes provide research opportunities for developing neural protection technology, turning instruments of oppression into tools of liberation.

## Strategic Intelligence Value

### Corporate Operation Mapping
Probe locations and targeting data reveal corporate harvesting priorities, enabling resistance forces to protect high-risk individuals and communities.

### Technology Countermeasures
Understanding probe operations helps resistance engineers develop better neural scramblers, detection systems, and protective equipment.

### Evidence for Justice
Documented probe operations provide evidence for future war crimes tribunals, ensuring corporate executives face accountability for systematic human rights violations.

## Symbol of Resistance Necessity

### Justification for Militant Action
The probe's existence justifies resistance actions that might otherwise seem extreme - when corporate forces treat human consciousness as commodity, self-defense becomes revolutionary duty.

### Community Mobilization Tool
Knowledge of neural harvesting operations motivates community organizing and resistance recruitment, transforming individual fear into collective action.

### Technology That Demands Destruction
Unlike tools that can be reformed or regulated, the neural harvesting probe serves no legitimate purpose - its only ethical use is as evidence before its complete destruction.

The WHIX Neural Harvesting Probe stands as the ultimate symbol of corporate evil - technology that treats human consciousness as a resource to be mined rather than a sacred aspect of human dignity to be protected and celebrated. Its existence in the game world provides moral clarity about the nature of the resistance struggle and the stakes involved in the fight for cognitive freedom.
