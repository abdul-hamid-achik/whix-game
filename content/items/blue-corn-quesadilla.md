# Blue Corn Quesadilla

## Description

Made from ancestral blue corn, these quesadillas are pressed fresh on a hot comal. The deep purple-blue tortillas are filled with stringy quesillo cheese, earthy huitlacoche (corn fungus), and delicate squash blossoms. A connection to pre-Hispanic Mexico that survived the Algorithm's homogenization attempts.

## Gameplay Effect

Blue corn contains anthocyanins that enhance neural function. Perfect for neurodivergent drivers who need to boost their pattern recognition abilities during complex delivery routes. The combination of ingredients provides sustained energy without the crash.

## Lore

The old woman at the market still grinds her corn on a volcanic stone metate, refusing the Algorithm's "efficiency improvements." She claims the blue corn can see through corporate surveillance, though that might just be the mezcal talking.

## Preparation Notes

- Must be eaten fresh from the comal
- Best paired with salsa verde
- The huitlacoche variant grants extra neural clarity
- Squash blossom filling available only in season
