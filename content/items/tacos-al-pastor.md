# Tacos al Pastor

## Description

The most iconic street food of Mexico City, these tacos represent the perfect fusion of Lebanese shawarma techniques with Mexican flavors. The marinated pork is stacked on a vertical trompo, slowly rotating beside an open flame, crowned with a fresh pineapple that caramelizes and drips its sweet juices onto the meat below.

## Gameplay Effect

When consumed, Tacos al Pastor provide an immediate stamina boost and temporarily increase your delivery speed. The combination of protein and quick carbs makes it perfect for drivers needing a quick energy boost between deliveries.

## Lore

In the dystopian streets of WHIX's Mexico City, the trompos still spin at every corner, a reminder of the city's culinary resilience. The Algorithm hasn't figured out how to automate the taquero's knife skills - yet.
