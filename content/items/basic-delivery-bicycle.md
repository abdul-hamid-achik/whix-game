lore: |
  The backbone of the delivery economy, these simple single-speed bikes can be seen on every street corner. Built to withstand daily use, they're designed for reliability over speed or comfort. Most delivery workers customize theirs with additional lights, better seats, and cargo solutions.
  
  "It's not pretty, but it gets me where I need to go," says Maria, a veteran food delivery worker. "I've put thousands of kilometers on this bike, and it's still running. Can't say that about most cars in this city."
  
  The bike represents independence - no boss controlling your schedule, no gas prices eating your profits, no parking tickets draining your earnings. Just you, the road, and the next delivery.

# Basic Delivery Bicycle: The Courier's Foundation

The most essential tool for any delivery worker, this simple bicycle represents freedom, independence, and the daily grind of gig economy work. Every scratch tells a story, every mile represents survival in an economy that demands constant motion.

## Practical Transportation

### Economic Independence
The bicycle requires no corporate fuel cards, no monthly payments, no insurance premiums. Your transportation costs are your own muscle power and occasional maintenance - true independence in the gig economy.

### Urban Efficiency
In congested city streets, bicycles often outperform cars and motorcycles. Bike lanes, shortcuts through parks, and the ability to navigate pedestrian areas make cycling the optimal choice for many delivery routes.

### Environmental Responsibility
Zero emissions transportation aligns with community values and provides a talking point with environmentally conscious customers, often leading to better tips and ratings.

## Real Worker Experience

### Daily Challenges
Rain-soaked rides to make rent payments, hills that test your determination, flat tires that eat into your earnings - the bicycle connects players to the authentic physical reality of delivery work.

### Personal Investment
Unlike corporate fleet vehicles, this bike is yours. The decision to upgrade parts, the responsibility for maintenance, the pride in keeping it running - all reflect the real emotional relationship between workers and their tools.

### Community Connection
The bicycle makes you part of the cycling community - other delivery workers who understand the struggle, bike mechanics who provide fair prices, advocates fighting for better bike infrastructure.

## Gameplay Integration

### Movement Mechanics
The bicycle provides authentic movement speed - fast enough to be efficient, slow enough that route planning matters. Weather effects create meaningful decision points about when to work.

### Economic Simulation
Maintenance costs and upgrade options create ongoing resource management decisions that mirror real gig worker financial planning.

### Skill Development
Systematic route planning, traffic awareness, and stamina management all translate to improved delivery performance, creating a progression system based on realistic skills.

In the Basic Delivery Bicycle, players experience the foundation of gig economy independence - simple tools, personal responsibility, and the determination to make it work despite all obstacles.
