lore: |
  Ricardo built this toolkit over three years, salvaging components from every corporate device he repaired, every neural interface he freed from malware, every surveillance system he disabled. Each tool was modified for a specific purpose - liberating minds from corporate control.
  
  "Every corporate neural device contains the seeds of its own liberation," he explains, adjusting a micro-circuit analyzer. "They build surveillance into the hardware, but they also build the tools we need to remove it. We just have to know where to look."
  
  The toolkit represents years of reverse-engineering corporate neural technology, understanding how surveillance works so it can be defeated. Ricardo's modifications turn corporate diagnostic tools into liberation instruments, corporate repair equipment into resistance weapons.
  
  But more than technical knowledge, the toolkit embodies Ricardo's love for his nephew Tom√°s and all neurodivergent children targeted by corporate recruitment. Every tool was crafted with the knowledge that young minds depend on the resistance's ability to protect cognitive freedom.
personalMotivation: |
  "My nephew sees patterns everywhere," Ricardo says, calibrating a neural scanner. "Beautiful patterns, complex patterns, patterns that could change the world. Corporate wants to harvest those patterns, use them for profit, turn his beautiful mind into their algorithm."
  
  "This toolkit is my promise to him - that when corporate comes for his mind, we'll be ready. Every tool here can break their conditioning, remove their malware, protect his thoughts. As long as resistance engineers exist, no child's mind belongs to corporate."

# Ricardo's Neural Interface Toolkit: Engineering Liberation

Ricardo's toolkit represents more than technical capability - it embodies the principle that technology becomes liberating when controlled by communities rather than corporations, when used to enhance rather than exploit human cognitive diversity, and when motivated by love rather than profit.

## Technical Mastery with Purpose

### Universal Liberation Capability
The toolkit works with any neural interface technology, from basic corporate monitoring devices to advanced conditioning equipment, ensuring no corporate neural control is beyond resistance reach.

### Malware Immunization Technology
Devices repaired with Ricardo's tools become permanently immune to corporate reinfection, creating expanding zones of cognitive freedom as the resistance liberates more neural interfaces.

### Resistance Integration
All liberated devices automatically connect to hidden resistance networks, creating a growing infrastructure of free communication and mutual support that exists outside corporate control.

## Innovation Born from Love

### Family Protection Motivation
Every tool was developed with Ricardo's nephew Tom√°s in mind - a brilliant neurodivergent child who represents the future corporate wants to control and the resistance fights to protect.

### Community Technical Support
The toolkit enables Ricardo to serve as technical backbone for resistance operations, repairing damaged equipment, enhancing ally capabilities, and creating countermeasures against corporate threats.

### Sustainable Resistance Infrastructure
By converting corporate technology to resistance purposes, the toolkit creates sustainable technical infrastructure that grows stronger as more corporate equipment is captured and liberated.

## Gameplay Innovation

### Technical Specialist Role
The toolkit enables players to specialize in technical support, becoming essential for resistance operations that require equipment repair, system infiltration, or device modification.

### Corporate System Infiltration
Advanced capabilities allow temporary access to corporate databases and surveillance systems, providing intelligence advantages and opportunities for sabotage.

### Liberation Technology Creation
The crafting system enables players to transform captured corporate technology into resistance equipment, turning the enemy's resources against them.

## Cognitive Enhancement Philosophy

### Neurodivergent Optimization
The toolkit's diagnostic and modification capabilities focus on enhancing natural neurodivergent traits rather than suppressing or normalizing them, supporting cognitive diversity as resistance strength.

### Individual Adaptation
Tools can customize neural interfaces for individual cognitive patterns, ensuring technology serves each person's unique mental processes rather than forcing conformity to standard configurations.

### Community Collaboration
Technical expertise becomes more powerful when combined with other resistance specialists, encouraging collaborative approaches to liberation challenges.

## Strategic Resistance Value

### Corporate Countermeasures
Understanding corporate neural technology enables development of effective countermeasures, staying ahead of corporate innovation through superior technical knowledge and community collaboration.

### Intelligence Gathering
Corporate system infiltration capabilities provide valuable intelligence about corporate operations, plans, and vulnerabilities that inform resistance strategy.

### Operational Support
Technical repair and enhancement capabilities make resistance operations more successful by ensuring equipment functions optimally and allies remain protected from neural attacks.

## Ethical Technology Development

### Consent and Autonomy
All modifications and enhancements require user consent and can be reversed or modified based on individual preferences and changing needs.

### Community Benefit
Technical development prioritizes resistance goals and community wellbeing over individual power or corporate efficiency metrics.

### Cognitive Freedom
The toolkit's primary purpose is protecting and enhancing cognitive freedom rather than controlling or manipulating neural function for external purposes.

## Legacy Protection

### Future Generation Security
Through protecting children like Tom√°s, the toolkit ensures cognitive freedom continues beyond the current resistance generation, creating lasting change rather than temporary victory.

### Knowledge Transfer
Ricardo's technical expertise becomes transferable through the toolkit, enabling other resistance members to develop liberation technology skills and expand technical capacity.

### Technological Sovereignty
The toolkit represents resistance technological independence - the ability to create, repair, and enhance technology without dependence on corporate systems or approval.

In Ricardo's Neural Interface Toolkit, players gain access to comprehensive technical liberation capabilities while embracing the principle that technology serves humanity best when developed by and for communities committed to cognitive freedom, enhanced human potential, and resistance to oppressive control systems.
