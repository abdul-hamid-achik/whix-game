# UI/UX Refactor Plan - WHIX Game

## Research Summary: Roguelike & RPG UI Best Practices

### Key Insights from Successful Games:
- **Hades**: Clean, contextual UI that appears/disappears based on game state
- **Dead Cells**: Minimalist HUD during gameplay, detailed menus when paused
- **FTL**: Tab-based navigation with clear visual hierarchy
- **Slay the Spire**: Card-game inspired clean interfaces
- **Hollow Knight**: Immersive UI that feels part of the game world
- **Risk of Rain 2**: Information-dense but organized HUD
- **Enter the Gungeon**: Pixel-art UI that matches game aesthetic
- **Legends of Kingdom Rush**: Turn-based RPG with roguelike progression and tactical party management

### Core UI Principles for Roguelikes/RPGs:
1. **Context-Sensitive**: UI should adapt to current game state
2. **Immersive**: UI elements should feel like part of the game world
3. **Accessible**: Quick access to essential information
4. **Scalable**: Easy to add new features without cluttering
5. **Consistent**: Unified design language throughout

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. **Sidebar Problems**
- ❌ Looks like a website admin panel, not a game interface
- ❌ Always visible during gameplay (breaks immersion)
- ❌ Too many unnecessary options exposed
- ❌ "Dashboard" is not game-appropriate terminology
- ❌ No visual hierarchy or grouping

### 2. **Navigation Issues**
- ❌ Website-style navigation doesn't fit game context
- ❌ No clear separation between "in-game" and "meta" actions
- ❌ Missing quick-access for common game actions

### 3. **Game State Management**
- ❌ No distinction between "in-mission" and "between-missions" UI
- ❌ Settings should be separate from gameplay interface
- ❌ No contextual menus for different game modes

## Legends of Kingdom Rush UI Analysis

### LKR's Successful Design Patterns:
1. **Character-Centric Interface**: Party management as core gameplay element
2. **Progressive Unlocking**: Start with 3 characters, unlock 15 more through gameplay
3. **Tactical Overview**: Clear turn-based action system (2 actions per character)
4. **Roguelike Adventure Map**: Randomized encounters with branching paths
5. **Event-Driven Progression**: Random events with dice-roll mechanics
6. **Attribute-Based Interactions**: Characters contribute to events based on their stats
7. **Multiple Game Modes**: Adventure runs, daily challenges, arena mode
8. **Epic Ability System**: Special powers triggered by status conditions

### LKR Interface Elements to Adopt:
- **Adventure Map**: Node-based progression with random events
- **Party Composition Screen**: Visual roster with character abilities
- **Turn-Based Action UI**: Clear action selection with preview
- **Character Progression**: Simple but effective leveling system
- **Event Resolution**: Dice mechanics with character stat bonuses
- **Mode Selection**: Clear distinction between different game types

### Key Lessons for WHIX:
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with fewer characters/options, unlock through play
2. **Clear Progression**: Visual feedback for character development
3. **Meaningful Choices**: Each decision should impact gameplay significantly
4. **Contextual Information**: Show relevant stats/abilities when needed
5. **Flexible Party System**: Allow different character combinations
6. **Event-Driven Narrative**: Use random events to tell story

## Proposed UI Refactor Plan

### Phase 1: Core Layout Restructure

#### 1.1 Replace Sidebar with Context-Aware Interface
**Current:** Always-visible sidebar
**New:** Dynamic interface based on game state

**Game States (Inspired by LKR):**
- **Command Center**: Character roster and campaign selection (like LKR's main menu)
- **Mission Briefing**: Party composition and loadout (like LKR's pre-adventure setup)
- **Adventure Map**: Node-based progression with encounters (like LKR's adventure map)
- **Tactical Combat**: Turn-based combat interface (like LKR's battle screen)
- **Event Resolution**: Story events with character interactions (like LKR's random events)
- **After Action**: Mission results and character progression

#### 1.2 New Navigation Structure (LKR-Inspired)
```
Main Game Flow:
├── Courier Hub (Character Roster)
│   ├── Available Partners - Unlock & manage team
│   ├── Campaign Selection - Choose your mission type
│   ├── Daily Contracts - Time-limited challenges
│   ├── Neural Upgrades - Character progression
│   └── Corporate Archive - Unlocked lore/story
├── Mission Briefing - Party composition & loadout
├── Adventure Map - Node-based story progression
├── Tactical Encounters - Turn-based events/combat
├── Story Events - Dialogue & character interactions
└── Performance Review - Mission results & rewards
```

### Phase 2: Visual Design Overhaul

#### 2.1 Aesthetic Direction
**Theme:** Cyberpunk Corporate Interface
- **Primary:** Dark backgrounds with neon accents
- **Colors:** Blue/cyan primary, amber/orange secondary, red for alerts
- **Typography:** Monospace/tech fonts for data, clean sans-serif for readable text
- **Elements:** Scanlines, subtle glitch effects, corporate branding

#### 2.2 Component Library
- **Panels:** Translucent dark panels with glowing borders
- **Buttons:** Corporate-style with hover animations
- **Progress Bars:** Segmented, tech-style with glow effects
- **Icons:** Consistent pixel-art or line-art style
- **Notifications:** Toast-style with corporate "WHIX" branding

### Phase 3: Context-Sensitive Menus

#### 3.1 Courier Hub Interface (LKR-Style)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### State Management
```typescript
enum GameState {
  HUB = 'hub',
  TACTICAL_MAP = 'tactical_map', 
  MISSION = 'mission',
  COMBAT = 'combat',
  INVENTORY = 'inventory',
  SETTINGS = 'settings'
}

interface UIState {
  currentState: GameState;
  previousState: GameState;
  contextData: any;
  panels: {
    [key: string]: {
      visible: boolean;
      position: 'left' | 'right' | 'center' | 'overlay';
      size: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'fullscreen';
    }
  }
}
