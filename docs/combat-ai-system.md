# Combat AI System Design

## Overview
The WHIX combat AI system is designed to create engaging, fair, and entertaining battles that adapt to player skill level and neurodivergent traits. The AI prioritizes player enjoyment over pure difficulty, creating memorable encounters that feel challenging but achievable.

## Core AI Philosophy

### Adaptive Difficulty
- **Player Skill Assessment**: AI continuously learns player patterns and adapts accordingly
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Combat difficulty adjusts in real-time based on player performance
- **Neurodivergent Accommodation**: AI recognizes and adapts to different cognitive styles and needs
- **Entertainment Priority**: AI makes choices that create engaging gameplay over optimal combat efficiency

### Behavioral Diversity
- **Personality-Driven AI**: Each enemy type has distinct behavior patterns and preferences
- **Emotional States**: AI characters have moods that affect their decision-making
- **Learning Capabilities**: AI remembers player tactics and develops counter-strategies
- **Mistake Simulation**: AI occasionally makes "human-like" errors to feel more natural

- **Resource Allocation**: Distribute healing, buffs, and special abilities
- **Tactical Coordination**: Coordinate multiple AI units for combined effects
- **Player Pressure**: Maintain appropriate challenge level without overwhelming

#### Long-Term Adaptation (Across Multiple Battles)
- **Player Profiling**: Learn individual player preferences and weaknesses
- **Strategy Evolution**: Develop new tactics in response to player adaptation
- **Difficulty Calibration**: Adjust overall challenge to maintain engagement
- **Narrative Integration**: Ensure AI behavior supports story and character development

- **Player Interaction**: Rewards systematic planning and pattern recognition

### White Supremacist Enforcers (Aggressive)
**Behavior Pattern**: Brutal, intimidating, individually focused
- **Strengths**: High damage output, fear effects, relentless pursuit
- **Weaknesses**: Poor teamwork, vulnerable when isolated, predictable aggression
- **AI Personality**: Prioritizes intimidation and individual glory
- **Player Interaction**: Rewards tactical positioning and team coordination

### Corrupted Church Members (Manipulative)
**Behavior Pattern**: Deceptive, support-focused, psychologically complex
- **Strengths**: Healing abilities, status effects, psychological manipulation
- **Weaknesses**: Lower direct damage, vulnerable to sustained pressure
- **AI Personality**: Uses misdirection and emotional manipulation
- **Player Interaction**: Rewards careful analysis and mental resilience

### Underground Resistance (Adaptive)
**Behavior Pattern**: Creative, resourceful, highly adaptable
- **Strengths**: Improvised tactics, environmental usage, surprising strategies
- **Weaknesses**: Limited resources, coordination challenges, unpredictable
- **AI Personality**: Thinks outside conventional combat rules
- **Player Interaction**: Encourages creative problem-solving and flexibility

## Trait-Responsive AI

### Hyperfocus Recognition
When AI detects player hyperfocus patterns:
- **Extended Engagement**: Provide longer, more complex tactical scenarios
- **Pattern Complexity**: Introduce intricate strategic puzzles to solve
- **Flow State Protection**: Avoid interrupting successful player engagement
- **Gradual Escalation**: Slowly increase complexity to maintain flow

### Pattern Recognition Adaptation
When AI detects strong player pattern recognition:
- **Pattern Variation**: Introduce subtle variations to established patterns
- **Meta-Patterns**: Create patterns-within-patterns for deeper analysis
- **False Patterns**: Occasionally break patterns to prevent over-reliance
- **Pattern Rewards**: Provide special recognition for pattern identification

### Enhanced Senses Consideration
When AI detects enhanced sensory processing:
- **Sensory Richness**: Provide detailed environmental and tactical information
- **Subtle Cues**: Include hidden information discoverable through careful observation
- **Sensory Overload Protection**: Avoid overwhelming sensory bombardment
- **Information Layering**: Present information at multiple sensory levels

## Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment

### Performance Metrics
The AI tracks multiple indicators of player engagement and success:
- **Win/Loss Ratio**: Overall battle success rate
- **Turn Efficiency**: How quickly players make effective decisions
- **Strategy Diversity**: Whether players experiment with different approaches
- **Engagement Level**: Time spent considering options and battle involvement

### Adjustment Mechanisms
Based on performance metrics, AI adjusts:
- **Damage Scaling**: Subtle modifications to incoming and outgoing damage
- **Resource Availability**: More or fewer healing items and special abilities
- **Enemy Coordination**: Tighter or looser AI team coordination
- **Tactical Complexity**: Simpler or more complex strategic scenarios
