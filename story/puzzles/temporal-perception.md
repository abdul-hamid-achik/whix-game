# The Temporal Perception Puzzle

## Core Mechanic
Players must navigate conversations where time moves differently for each participant. The Old Timer exists 13 minutes ahead, some NPCs lag 13 minutes behind, and Miguel experiences "now."

## Implementation

### Visual Indicators
- **Ahead of Time**: Blue aura, stuttering animations
- **Behind Time**: Red aura, echo effects
- **Present Time**: Normal appearance
- **Synchronized**: Golden glow

### Puzzle Stages

#### Stage 1: Recognition
Players must identify which temporal state NPCs are in:
- Speech patterns give clues ("will have been" vs "was going to be")
- Actions don't match words (reaching for objects not there yet)
- Environmental mismatches (rain that hasn't started, shadows at wrong angles)

#### Stage 2: Simple Synchronization
Align two timelines:
```
NPC (Future): "Thanks for the package you're about to give me."
Options:
1. Give package now → Temporal paradox, NPC vanishes
2. Wait 13 minutes → Success
3. Ask about the package → Learn what they need
```

#### Stage 3: Complex Weaving
Multiple NPCs in different time states:
```
Customer A (+13): "The protest is starting!"
Partner B (-13): "What protest?"
Enforcer C (0): "There's no authorized gathering today."

Solution: Use future knowledge to prevent past events
```

#### Stage 4: The Time Knot
The Old Timer creates a temporal recursion:
```
OLD TIMER: "You already told me what I'm about to tell you."
MIGUEL: "But you haven't said anything yet."
OLD TIMER: "I will have, once you remember to forget."
```

Solution requires tracking information across multiple loops.

## Advanced Mechanics

### Temporal Items
Objects exist in specific timestreams:
- **Future Items**: Intangible until their time comes
- **Past Items**: Degrading, leaving only traces
- **Temporal Constants**: Exist across all timestreams

### The 13-Minute Window
- Actions have consequences 13 minutes later
- Information learned can be used 13 minutes earlier
- Some puzzles require playing through multiple times

### Temporal Traits

#### Hyperfocus
"When focused, time dilates. 13 minutes feel like hours."
- Extends interaction windows
- Reveals hidden temporal layers

#### Pattern Recognition  
"The cycles are visible to those who see patterns."
- Shows temporal flow visualization
- Predicts NPC time states

#### Routine Mastery
"Repetition transcends time."
- Actions become temporal constants
- Can perform same action across timestreams

## Example Puzzle: The Delivery Paradox

### Setup
You must deliver a package that:
- Customer ordered 13 minutes ago (past)
- You'll receive in 13 minutes (future)
- Must be delivered now (present)

### Solution Path
1. Talk to Future Vendor (+13) to learn package contents
2. Find Past Customer (-13) before they order
3. Convince them to order something different
4. Receive the changed package in present
5. Deliver to satisfied customer

### Hidden Solution
With high Humanity Index:
- Realize the package contains medicine
- The temporal confusion is causing real suffering
- Break protocol to deliver medicine immediately
- Accept consequence to help someone

## Temporal Dialogue Examples

### The Confused Merchant
```
MERCHANT (-13): "Are you here for the thing?"
MIGUEL: "What thing?"
MERCHANT: "The thing you asked about!"
MIGUEL: "I haven't asked about anything."
MERCHANT: "You will. In... negative time?"
[MERCHANT begins to cry from temporal vertigo]
```

### The Prophet Customer  
```
CUSTOMER (+13): "I'm leaving a bad review."
MIGUEL: "But I haven't delivered yet."
CUSTOMER: "No, but you will have been late."
MIGUEL: "So I can still be on time?"
CUSTOMER: "Were you listening? You WILL HAVE BEEN late. It's already happened in my timeline."
```

### The Synchronized Moment
When all timelines align:
```
EVERYONE: "Now."
[For 13 seconds, everyone exists in the same moment]
[Secret truths can be shared]
[The Algorithm cannot see synchronized time]
```

## Rewards for Mastery

### Temporal Sight
- See 13 minutes ahead on the map
- Predict NPC movements
- Avoid future obstacles

### Causal Immunity  
- Actions don't create paradoxes
- Can exist in multiple timestreams
- Old Timer speaks clearly

### The Truth of Time
Ultimate revelation: The neighborhood exists in a 13-minute loop. Every delivery, every route, every tip—all happening simultaneously, forever. The only escape is to break the cycle entirely.

## Meta Commentary
This puzzle system reflects how gig workers exist in multiple timeframes:
- Past: Debt from equipment and bills
- Present: Current deliveries and survival
- Future: The false promise of eventual success

The temporal confusion IS the exploitation.
