# The Old Timer's Paradox

## Overview
The Old Timer appears exactly 13 minutes before significant events, creating a Kafkaesque loop of predetermined fate. His appearance triggers a countdown timer visible only to partners with Time Perception traits.

## Mechanics

### Appearance Pattern
- **First encounter**: Grants 30-second foresight of one map tile
- **Second encounter**: Reveals movement patterns of all NPCs for 2 turns
- **Third encounter**: Shows Tania's exact location for 1 turn
- **Fourth encounter**: The Old Timer speaks a complete sentence, revealing a game-changing secret

### Puzzle Elements
1. Players must track his appearances across multiple runs
2. His spawn points form a pattern on the map (clock face)
3. Answering with the "wrong" time (13 minutes ahead) breaks his loop temporarily

## Deeper Meaning
The Old Timer represents workers trapped in temporal poverty—so busy surviving they can't perceive time passing. His inability to hear the answer mirrors how the system ignores workers' voices.

## Dialogue Tree

### First Encounter
```
OLD TIMER: "Excuse me, young person. Do you have the time?"

> "It's 3:47 PM."
  OLD TIMER: (Already leaving) "No, no, that's not right at all..."
  MIGUEL: "But that's what my phone says—"
  [The Old Timer vanishes around a corner that doesn't exist]

> "Time? Time is what Whix steals from us."
  OLD TIMER: (Pauses, turns slightly) "Ah, you're beginning to see. But not deeply enough."
  [Grants 60-second foresight instead of 30]

> [Pattern Recognition] "You mean the time 13 minutes from now."
  OLD TIMER: (Freezes completely) "You... how did you... no, it's too soon."
  [Map reveals a hidden symbol]

> Say nothing
  OLD TIMER: "Your silence speaks volumes. Like mine, once."
  [No immediate reward, but encounter counter advances by 2]
```

### Fourth Encounter - The Revelation
```
OLD TIMER: "You again. Or is it me again? In this labyrinth, who can tell?"

MIGUEL: "You're not asking for the time. You're warning about it."

OLD TIMER: "I was Employee #1 at Whix. I invented the algorithm that calculates tip percentages. Do you know what my masterpiece does?"

> "It exploits workers."
  OLD TIMER: "No! It exploits TIME. Every delivery, every route, every star—all calculated to waste exactly enough time to keep you from escaping."

> "It traps us in the neighborhood."
  OLD TIMER: "The neighborhood? Child, the neighborhood IS the algorithm. These streets reshape themselves based on your desperation metrics."

> "Why warn us?"
  OLD TIMER: "Because I'm trapped in my own creation. I ask for the time because I no longer experience it linearly. Your 3:47 is my eternity."

MIGUEL: "How do we break free?"

OLD TIMER: "Tania knows. Why do you think she ran? But beware—the knowledge costs more than stars. It costs your humanity index."

[UNLOCK: Ability to see the neighborhood's algorithmic patterns]
[WARNING: Humanity index system revealed]

## Rewards & Consequences
- **Temporal Sight**: Brief glimpses of future events
- **Pattern Recognition**: Hidden symbols appear on the map
- **Algorithm Awareness**: See the mathematical structure of the neighborhood
- **Cost**: Each revelation decreases sanity/increases algorithm awareness
