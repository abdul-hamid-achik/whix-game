# The Birthday Wish - A Child's Invisible Celebration

## Overview
Mateo's 7th birthday occurs during every run, but no one remembers. His parents fight about money while he sits invisible, recreating the same wish on the same candle-less cake-shaped cardboard.

## Multi-Stage Puzzle

### Stage 1 - Discovery
- Players hear fighting through the cage house bars
- **[Pattern Recognition]** reveals the parents repeat the same argument verbatim
- **[Enhanced Hearing]** catches Mateo whispering his wish

### Stage 2 - Choice Matrix
1. **Force Entry** → Combat with parents → Trauma to Mateo → Dark path unlocked
2. **Negotiate** → Social puzzle requiring specific dialogue choices → Temporary peace
3. **The Cake Quest** → Find Mateo's dream cake → Permanent ally → Secret paths

### Stage 3 - The Wish
If players bring the correct cake (chocolate with race cars, not princess themed), Mateo reveals: "I wished for someone to see me."

## Consequences Across Runs
- **Traumatized Mateo**: Becomes hostile in future encounters
- **Helped Mateo**: Leaves chalk arrows pointing to shortcuts
- **Befriended Mateo**: Can enter any locked building once per run

## Complete Dialogue Tree

### Initial Approach
```
[Sounds of breaking dishes and shouting from within]

MOTHER: "FORTY PESOS FOR MILK? WHEN I WAS YOUNG—"
FATHER: "WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG, WHIX DIDN'T EXIST!"
MATEO: (Barely audible) "When I was young... yesterday..."

> Knock on the bars
  FATHER: "Another Whix parasite! We gave at the office!"
  > "I'm not here to take. I need to pass through."
    MOTHER: "Pass through? This is our HOME, not your shortcut!"
    > "I apologize. May I help somehow?"
      [Pathway to negotiation]
    > "Your home blocks a public alley."
      [Pathway to conflict]

> Call out to the child
  MATEO: (Pressing face against bars) "Are you here for my birthday?"
  > "Is it your birthday? Happy birthday!"
    MATEO: "You're the first to say that. Even I forgot until just now."
    [UNLOCKS: Mateo's trust pathway]
  > "I'm looking for someone. A woman named Tania?"
    MATEO: "The fast lady? She climbed over our house. Mama threw a pan."
    [REVEALS: Alternative route]

> [Enhanced Hearing] Listen before engaging
  MOTHER: "—can't even afford the CAKE he wants!"
  FATHER: "He doesn't need a cake! When I was his age—"
  MATEO: (Singing softly) "Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me..."
  [KNOWLEDGE: The cake is the key to everything]
```

### The Cake Quest Branch
```
MIGUEL: "What kind of cake does Mateo want?"

MOTHER: (Suddenly exhausted) "Race cars. Red frosting. Chocolate inside. Forty-seven pesos at the good bakery."

FATHER: "Forty-seven! For flour and sugar!"

> "I'll get it. Consider it a birthday gift."
  MOTHER: (Suspicious) "What's your angle, Whix?"
  > "No angle. Just humanity."
    [Both parents begin crying]
    [HUMANITY INDEX: +10]
  > "Maybe you'll remember this when I need help."
    FATHER: "A transaction. At least that's honest."
    [PRAGMATISM PATHWAY]

[After retrieving the cake]

MATEO: "It's... it's exactly right. How did you know?"

> "I listened."
  MATEO: "Nobody listens. Are you broken like me?"
  > "Maybe we're not broken. Maybe we just see differently."
    MATEO: "The lady you're chasing—she said that too. Before she changed."
    [CLUE: Tania's transformation was gradual]

[REWARD: The family moves aside, Mateo draws a map on your hand with frosting showing three secret passages]
