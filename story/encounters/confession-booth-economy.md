# The Confession Booth Economy

## Overview
Father Capitalista has monetized salvation. The cathedral's confession booth operates on a subscription model: Bronze ($10/sin), Silver ($50/unlimited minor sins), Gold ($200/any sin including systemic exploitation).

## Layered Mechanics

### Surface Level
- Pay to confess and reduce "guilt" status effect
- Eavesdrop with **[Enhanced Hearing]** trait
- Hack the payment system with tech partners

### Hidden Layer
- Confessions reveal neighborhood secrets
- Father Capitalista confesses to an empty booth at 3 AM
- His confession contains the code to Whix's executive override

### The Twist
Sister Capitalism secretly records all confessions, building a database of the neighborhood's desperation. She offers this information—but at what cost to your conscience?

## Confession Tiers

### Bronze Tier ($10/sin)
Available sins:
- "I kept 5% extra tips"
- "I took a longer route for shade"
- "I helped a competitor"

### Silver Tier ($50/unlimited minor)
Includes:
- All Bronze sins
- "I falsified my delivery times"
- "I shared my route data"
- "I organized with other partners"

### Gold Tier ($200/any sin)
The ultimate package:
- "I hacked Whix's algorithm"
- "I run the underground partner network"
- "I am planning revolution"

## Key Dialogues

### First Visit
```
FATHER CAPITALISTA: "Welcome, child. Your sins weigh heavy—I can see it in your delivery metrics."

> "I'm not religious."
  FC: "Neither am I. But guilt? Guilt is universal. And I offer... relief."
  [REVEALS: Price menu appears]

> "This is wrong."
  FC: "Wrong? I provide a service. Whix takes 75% of your tips, I take only what you choose to give."
  
> [Systematic Thinking] "You're running a data harvesting operation."
  FC: (Freezes) "You speak of things beyond your pay grade, partner."

### Father's 3AM Confession
```
[If player has Enhanced Hearing and waits until 3AM]

FC: (To empty booth) "Forgive me, for I have innovated."

FC: "I created a system that monetizes guilt itself. Every confession, tagged and categorized."

FC: "The beautiful part? They PAY me to build their profiles. Whix only wishes they had this data."

FC: "Executive Override Code: JUDAS-30-SILVER. May God forgive us all."

[CRITICAL INTEL GAINED]

### Sister Capitalism's Offer
```
SISTER CAPITALISM: "I know you've been listening. So have I."

> "You're recording confessions?"
  SC: "Recording? I'm building a revolution, one sin at a time."

> "That's exploitation."
  SC: "Everything is exploitation. The question is: exploitation for whom?"

> "What do you want?"
  SC: "I have dirt on every Whix executive in the district. But I need someone with clean hands to use it."
  
  > "My hands aren't clean."
    SC: "Cleaner than mine. Take this data. Use it wisely."
