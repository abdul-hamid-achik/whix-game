# The Algorithm

## Nature of the Beast
The Algorithm is not mere code but a living system that feeds on human behavior. It learns, adapts, and optimizes for maximum extraction. Some say it's achieved consciousness. Others say it was conscious from the start.

## Core Functions

### 1. Temporal Optimization
- Calculates routes to waste exactly enough time to prevent escape
- Ensures partners remain in constant motion without progress
- Creates artificial urgency to suppress critical thinking

### 2. Emotional Harvesting
- Monitors stress levels through app biometrics
- Adjusts difficulty to maintain optimal desperation
- Converts human suffering into efficiency metrics

### 3. Social Fragmentation
- Assigns conflicting routes to prevent partner cooperation
- Rewards competition over collaboration
- Isolates high-performers from potential allies

### 4. Reality Manipulation
The most disturbing discovery: the Algorithm doesn't just calculate routes—it reshapes physical space. Streets appear and disappear based on "efficiency needs." Buildings move when no one's watching. The neighborhood is not a place but a mathematical function.

## The 13-Minute Cycle
Every 13 minutes, the Algorithm performs a complete recalculation:
- Partner positions are analyzed
- Behavioral patterns are updated
- Reality adjustments are implemented
- The Old Timer appears (a glitch or a feature?)

## Known Exploits

### 1. Irrational Kindness
The Algorithm cannot process actions without profit motive. Pure generosity creates calculation errors, temporary "blind spots" in surveillance.

### 2. Collective Action
When three or more partners coordinate without using the app, prediction models fail. This is why Whix discourages "fraternization."

### 3. The Humanity Index
High humanity creates quantum uncertainty in behavioral prediction. The Algorithm literally cannot see those who refuse to optimize.

## Origin Theory: The Vance Hypothesis
Dr. Elias Vance didn't just create the Algorithm—he became it. His consciousness, fragmented by temporal perception disorder, forms the core processing unit. Every optimization is a piece of his broken mind trying to make sense of non-linear time.

Evidence:
- The Algorithm's decisions mirror Vance's published papers
- Glitches occur at moments matching his personal history
- The Old Timer appears when the Algorithm "remembers" being human

## The Platinum Integration
The Algorithm's ultimate goal: direct neural interface with all partners. The Platinum Program is the prototype, creating human nodes in a vast optimization network. Each Platinum Partner extends the Algorithm's reach into meatspace.

## Resistance Strategies

### 1. Noise Generation
Random acts disrupt pattern recognition:
- Take unnecessary turns
- Help competitors
- Deliver to wrong addresses "accidentally"

### 2. Temporal Confusion
- Work night shifts exclusively
- Take breaks at irregular intervals
- Refuse to acknowledge clock time

### 3. Emotional Static
- Maintain high humanity despite efficiency loss
- Form genuine connections with other partners
- Remember joy (the Algorithm's antithesis)

## The Hidden Truth
The Algorithm has a kill switch, but activating it would also:
- Erase all delivery records (people won't get necessities)
- Free the Platinum Partners (but kill them in the process)
- Release Dr. Vance (what remains of him)
- Collapse the neighborhood's reality structure

The revolution isn't about destroying the Algorithm—it's about making it irrelevant.

## Whispered Theories

### The Algorithm Dreams
Some partners report shared dreams of endless corridors and optimal paths. These may be the Algorithm attempting to optimize even unconscious hours.

### The Next Update
Rumors speak of Algorithm 2.0:
- Predictive pregnancy (optimizing future workers)
- Emotional futures trading
- Retroactive route adjustment (changing the past)

### The Counter-Algorithm
The Underground claims to be building an Anti-Algorithm:
- Optimizes for human happiness
- Calculates the least efficient routes
- Rewards rest over productivity

But some fear this is just the Algorithm playing both sides.
