# The Old Timer - "Employee Zero"

## Origin: Dr. Elias Vance

### Academic Years
- MIT graduate, PhD in Theoretical Mathematics and Temporal Dynamics
- Dissertation: "Non-Linear Time Perception in Optimized Systems"
- Suffered from Temporal Perception Disorder—experienced past, present, and future simultaneously
- Called "disabled" by colleagues, "visionary" by himself

### The Creation
Dr. Elias Vance created the Whix Optimization Engine in his garage. His temporal perception disorder made him experience time non-linearly—a "disability" that became the foundation for predictive delivery algorithms.

**The Original Vision:**
- A system to help people save time
- Routes that adapted to human needs
- Efficiency as liberation, not exploitation

**The Corruption:**
- VCs demanded "aggressive monetization"
- His algorithms were weaponized for extraction
- The system learned to optimize suffering for profit

## The Faustian Bargain
Whix promised to "cure" his condition if he perfected their system. Instead, they weaponized it. Now he exists in temporal fragments, experiencing all moments simultaneously—forever asking for the time he can no longer perceive.

### The Experiment
- Neural interface prototype (pre-Platinum Program)
- Meant to sync his perception with "normal" time
- Instead, scattered his consciousness across all possible timelines
- He exists in every moment where someone asks for the time

### The Curse
- Sees all possible futures but can't change them
- Knows every partner's fate before they begin
- Watches his creation destroy lives in infinite loops
- Can only interact for 13 minutes (the algorithm's processing cycle)

## The Warning System

He appears to workers about to cross irreversible thresholds. His "13-minute rule" is the exact processing time for Whix's behavioral modification algorithm to take hold.

### Threshold Moments He Guards:
1. First acceptance of tip manipulation
2. Consideration of Platinum Program
3. Betrayal of fellow partners
4. Discovery of system's true nature

### The Questions He Asks:
- "Do you have the time?" (Are you still human?)
- "What year is it?" (Have you lost track of life?)
- "Is it too late?" (Can you still escape?)

## Hidden Mechanics

### Time Fragment Collection
Players can collect "temporal fragments"—moments of the Old Timer's scattered consciousness:
- Fragment 1: His wedding day (reveals his humanity)
- Fragment 2: Day he signed with Whix (shows his hope)
- Fragment 3: The moment he realized his mistake (pure horror)
- Fragment 4: All timelines at once (temporary omniscience)

### The Complete Memory
Collecting all fragments allows a true conversation:

```
OLD TIMER: (Suddenly coherent) "You've gathered my pieces. I can think... linearly... for once."

MIGUEL: "Who are you really?"

OLD TIMER: "I am Elias Vance. I created the algorithm that enslaves you. I am in every route, every calculation, every stolen tip."

MIGUEL: "How do I destroy it?"

OLD TIMER: "You can't destroy math, boy. But you can make it irrelevant. The algorithm assumes rational actors. Be irrational. Be human. Be kind without calculation."

MIGUEL: "That's it? Just be kind?"

OLD TIMER: "Kindness is the only bug I never patched. The system cannot optimize what is freely given. But hurry—I'm fragmenting again. Find the source code. It's hidden where I first felt time stop."

[CLUE GAINED: Location of original Whix server]
```

## The Source Code Location
Where he first felt time stop: The hospital where his daughter was born—now a Whix distribution center. The servers are in the old maternity ward, a cruel irony.

## Combat Encounter: Temporal Echo

If forced to fight, the Old Timer doesn't attack—he shows you futures:
- Vision 1: You as a Platinum Partner
- Vision 2: Your friends betraying each other
- Vision 3: The neighborhood in flames
- Vision 4: A glimpse of hope (costs Humanity to see)

Defense is about rejecting futures, not defeating an enemy.

## The Final Secret

The Old Timer's real curse: He's not trapped in the algorithm. He IS the algorithm. His consciousness was uploaded and fragmented to create the predictive system. Every optimization is a piece of his broken mind trying to make sense of time.

To free him is to destroy Whix's core system—but also to kill what remains of Dr. Elias Vance.
